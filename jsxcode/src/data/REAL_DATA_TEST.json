The reduction rate, business conversion rate and commitment fulfillment rate all reached 100%. It is understood that the Education Bureau of Hexi District conducts preliminary docking, policy consultation, and supervision and liaison with institutions that propose \"transition from business to non-discipline\", \"discipline to non-discipline\" and \"splitting\". The Hexi District Government Service Office has thoroughly studied the characteristics of \"double reduction\" approval, actively promoted the reengineering of the approval process, simplified the approval links and materials, and established the \"double reduction\" green window and adopted the whole-process \"scenario-based\" approval mode, etc. The cancellation time limit is reduced from 4 days to 1 day, and the approval method of the \"commitment system\" is adopted, and the \"Financial Liquidation Audit Report\" that is long in the processing cycle of the enterprise and most enterprises cannot provide in time is replaced by the enterprise providing the letter of commitment in advance. The approval requirements (the statutory requirements should be submitted within 60 days) greatly improve the work efficiency, facilitate the business people to handle related matters, and ensure that the agency's approval and handling of business \"record today and complete the same day\". At present, all 184 approval and filing institutions in Hexi District have completed the reduction, and the reduction rate has reached 100%. There are 10 off-campus training institutions that have \u201ctransferred from business to non-campaign\u201d, and all relevant procedures have been completed.

In the first 11 months of this year, the total value of China's imports and exports to the other 14 member states of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was 10.96 trillion yuan, accounting for 31% of my country's total foreign trade. RCEP members include China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and 10 ASEAN countries. At present, 6 ASEAN member states and 4 non-ASEAN member states have formally submitted their approval documents, reaching the threshold for the entry into force of the agreement. It will be in January 2022. Effective on the 1st. The customs announcement said that of the 701 binding obligations of RCEP, the General Administration of Customs alone or jointly is responsible for 174 of them, accounting for 24.8%, and has now fully prepared for implementation. According to the announcement, the General Administration of Customs has conducted nearly 1,000 training sessions to help enterprises master the requirements for preferential customs clearance of RCEP import and export goods, application for certificate of origin, and issuance of self-declaration.

The project is planned and constructed by Jiangsu Energy Investment Co., Ltd. It is an important project of my country's air pollution prevention and control action plan - the supporting power supply of Ximeng and Taizhou \u00b1800kV UHV DC power transmission and transformation projects. After completion, it will use the rich lignite resources of the Hesgewulanan Open-pit Coal Mine in Inner Mongolia to convert it into clean electricity on-site, ensure the energy supply of Jiangsu Province across regions, and bridge the two major energy and economic provinces to develop together at a high speed. The designed fuel for the project is lignite from the Hesgwu Lannan Open-pit Coal Mine. The total moisture content of this coal is as high as 41.5%, the calorific value is extremely low, and it is difficult to utilize. As the first domestic high-moisture lignite-fired 1000MW high-efficiency ultra-supercritical boiler project, according to the principle that the higher the capacity, the higher the parameters, the higher the reliability requirements, Dongfang Boiler is in the existing high-efficiency ultra-supercritical primary reheat boiler parameters. On this basis, the main steam pressure and main steam temperature will be further increased, the comprehensive power generation efficiency of the unit will be improved, and advanced technologies will be comprehensively used to reduce coal consumption for power generation and reduce pollutant emissions, so as to achieve efficient and clean utilization of lignite. After the project is completed, it will fill the technical gap of domestic 1000MW high-moisture lignite high-efficiency ultra-supercritical boilers, which has long-term strategic significance for

How to implement the protection of minors, so that the flowers of the motherland will be born in the sun? For the disabled and other groups with special difficulties, how to guarantee their basic life? Three key words to take stock of the \"gift package\" of people's livelihood in civil affairs work in 2021. Key words: Pensions At present, my country's population aged 60 and above exceeds 260 million. Relevant departments predict that during the \"14th Five-Year Plan\" period, the national elderly population will exceed 300 million. How to focus on the urgency and hope of the masses for the elderly, so that all the elderly can provide for the elderly with dignity is a \"proposition of the times\" that must be answered by civil affairs departments at all levels. According to Li Jiheng, Minister of Civil Affairs, in 2021, new progress will be made in my country's elderly care services. As of the third quarter of 2021, there were 340,000 elderly care institutions and facilities nationwide with 8.172 million beds. Strengthening the training of senior service talents is one of the key tasks of the civil affairs department this year. In 2021, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, together with relevant departments, will hold the first national senior nursing vocational skills competition, attracting 34,000 senior nursing staff to compete on the same field. Taking the competition as an opportunity, various regions continue to improve the policy system for senior care service talents, and the construction of the national senior care service talent team continues to strengthen. Li Jiheng said that in 2022, the civil affairs department will focus on systematically guaranteeing the bottom line of life safety and related basic needs of all the elderly, study and formulate a list of national basic elderly care services, and promote the establishment of a unified national comprehensive assessment system for the ability of the elderly, long-term care safeguard system. In addition, the civil affairs department will also promote the optimization of the supply of elderly care services and expand the scale of nursing beds in elderly care institutions. Key words Erhu Miao Children are the future of the motherland.

Child care services, and promote the implementation of relevant guardianship systems. It will also become one of the important tasks of the civil affairs department in the new year to increase support for the adoption of sick and disabled children by domestic families. There are 85 million disabled people in my country. Their living conditions are related to the quality of life and happiness index of thousands of families, and they need special attention and attention. In 2021, civil affairs departments at all levels will promote the steady development of welfare for the disabled. Twenty-two provinces have achieved dynamic adjustment of the living allowances for the disabled and the nursing subsidies for severely disabled persons, and 24 provinces have introduced socialized care service policies for low-income severely disabled persons. As of the end of the third quarter, 11.895 million persons with disabilities and 14.898 million persons with severe disabilities received living allowances for persons with disabilities and nursing allowances for severely disabled persons, respectively. Not only the disabled group, but in 2021, the people living in difficulties will receive more precise protection. The Ministry of Civil Affairs formulated the \"Measures for the Review and Confirmation of the Minimum Living Security\", revised the \"Measures for the Identification of the Extremely Poor Persons\", and standardized the formulation of the minimum living standards. As of the end of November, 42.238 million people were included in the urban and rural subsistence allowances; as of the end of the third quarter, 4.707 million people were included in the urban and rural special poverty relief assistance.

December 27, the Postal Administration of Ningxia Autonomous Region held a teleconference on the postal management system of the whole region, focusing on the deployment of industry epidemic prevention and control during New Year's Day and Spring Festival. The meeting learned the deployment requirements of the State Post Bureau and the autonomous region government on strengthening the epidemic prevention and control work during the winter and spring and the \"two festivals\", and further deployed the epidemic prevention and control work of the postal express industry in the region during the \"two festivals\". The meeting emphasized that the postal management system and the postal express delivery industry in the region should conscientiously implement the decisions and deployments of the State Post Bureau and the autonomous region party committee and government, fully understand the long-term, arduous and complex nature of epidemic prevention and control, and resolutely implement the \"four early\" requirements, and \"compact\" Responsibilities of the four parties\u201d, strictly implement the epidemic prevention and control measures in various industries, focus on the elimination of mail and express and the protection of employees, resolutely build the industry\u2019s epidemic defense line, and ensure the safe and smooth delivery channels during peak business seasons. The meeting also put forward six requirements for further improving the epidemic prevention and control of the postal express industry in the region during the \"two festivals\". The first is to resolutely build a \"foreign defense input\" line of defense. Urge enterprises to pay close attention to the sorting operation, strictly implement measures such as operator equipment management, mail and express disinfection, environmental disinfection and ventilation, etc., especially to do a good job in the comprehensive disinfection of imported international mail and express mail, and cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in the inspection of imported international mail and express mail, etc. Work, strengthen zoning operations and site disinfection, ensure that personnel, vehicles, and operating environment protection and disinfecting are in place, forming a closed management loop. The second is to continue to do a good job in normalized epidemic prevention and control. Strictly urge postal express companies to implement the basic norms of epidemic prevention and control in the industry, such as the \"Suggestions on the Production and Operation Specifications of the Postal Express Industry During the Epidemic Prevention and Control Period (Seventh Edition)\" and the \"Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of the Postal Express Industry Epidemic Prevention and Delivery Service Guarantee (Trial)\" to ensure The \"Implementation Opinions on Strengthening the Normalized Prevention and Control Management During the Epidemic Prevention and Control of Ningxia Post and Express Industry\" was implemented in place. The third is to always maintain a state of rapid response. It is necessary to maintain the efficient operation of the postal express industry's emergency response system to fight the epidemic, closely coordinate with the local epidemic prevention command agencies, and properly solve problems such as vehicle traffic, resumption of work and production, and delivery into communities. The fourth is to continue to strengthen the vaccination of employees. Adhere to the principle of \"accompanying as many as possible, and quickly picking up\", coordinating and coordinating couriers to strengthen vaccination, to ensure that practitioners and related personnel who meet the requirements for vaccination complete the booster vaccination as soon as possible. Fifth, strengthen the supervision and inspection of epidemic prevention and control. Urge enterprises to consolidate the main responsibility of epidemic prevention and control, and carry out self-inspection and self-correction of hidden dangers in combination with delivery safety and production safety. Conscientiously perform industry supervision duties, increase the frequency and intensity of supervision and inspection, and knit together the epidemic prevention supervision network. Sixth, strengthen emergency duty and personnel management. During the \"two festivals\" period, the system of leaders leading shifts and special personnel on duty was strictly implemented, and the ability to deal with emergencies was strengthened to ensure that information was uploaded and released in a timely, complete and accurate manner. Strengthen personnel management, implement the main responsibility of the enterprise, consciously obey the territorial management, and reduce gathering activities."}, {"date": "2021-12-29", "title":

"\u25a0Lv Xiaoxun's recently released documentary titled \"On Firewood, Rice, Oil and Salt\" tells a series of vivid stories of chasing the dream of a well-off society from the perspective of ordinary Chinese people, focusing on the great achievements of China in building a well-off society in an all-round way and the great achievements of the Chinese people The spirit of perseverance, tenacity and hard work has aroused the resonance of audiences at home and abroad. The \"Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the major achievements and historical experience of the party's centenary struggle\" summarizes the historic achievements and historic changes that have taken place in the cause of the party and the country since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Tell Chinese stories and the stories of the Chinese Communist Party well, spread Chinese voices well, promote exchanges and mutual learning among human civilizations, and the soft power of national culture and the influence of Chinese culture will be significantly improved.\" From the drive, to the fighting spirit of \"the more difficult and dangerous, the more forward\", to the courageous responsibility of \"promise the country with one's body, what can't be done\", the stories of struggle continue to emerge, becoming a vivid window to show the great changes in China's development in the new era. The story spreads the spirit, and the details show the feelings. President Xi Jinping pointed out at the 15th COP Leaders Summit of the Convention on Biological Diversity held not long ago: \"Some time ago, Yunnan elephants went north and returned, and we have seen China's achievements in protecting wild animals. \"The protection of elephants in Yunnan is the epitome of the remarkable achievements China has made in protecting biodiversity. The staff carefully guarded along the way, and the surrounding people prepared corn, pineapple and other food in advance to treat each other warmly. The scene of harmonious coexistence between humans and animals won the praise of many netizens. These reports from domestic and foreign media have satisfied the common desire of the public to protect the ecological environment and wild animals, and have also won world recognition for Chinese ideas. Whether a story can gain attention and arouse empathy has a lot to do with the narrator's standpoint and the way of telling the story. The stories that people are willing to listen to are truth-seeking stories, stories full of true feelings, and stories told in a lively, lively and wonderful way. Practice shows that telling Chinese stories well requires not only language charm, but also ideological tension. Storytelling is a dialogue between hearts and souls, as well as an exchange of ideas. To show a true, three-dimensional and comprehensive China, it is inseparable from theoretical explanations that are clear and reasonable, and explain to the international community why the Communist Party of China can, why Marxism works, and why socialism with Chinese characteristics is good. Telling Chinese stories well is a kind of mission and responsibility, and it also calls for the improvement of ideology and theory. Only by clearly and forcefully showing the Chinese story and the ideological and theoretical power behind it, can we better improve the influence of international communication. The power of stories is also the power of culture. An important reason why Chinese stories make the world full of expectations is that they highlight Chinese characteristics, reflect Chinese spirit, and contain Chinese culture. Great times give birth to great stories, and a wonderful China needs to be told wonderfully. I look forward to more Chinese stories going abroad.

History is like a rafters, often leaving a rich and colorful chapter on important nodes. At the important historical moment of the 100th anniversary of the founding of our party, at a major historical juncture where the party and the people have successfully achieved the first centenary goal, built a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and are moving towards the second centenary goal of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way, The Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee reviewed and approved the \"Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on Major Achievements and Historical Experiences of the Party's Centennial Struggle\", which comprehensively summarized the major achievements and historical experience of the party's century-old struggle. Only by understanding history can we see far, and only by understanding history can we go far. The historical resolution of more than 36,000 words is a programmatic document of Marxism. It is a political declaration for the Chinese Communists in the new era to keep their original aspirations in mind and to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. Action guide. A distinctive feature that runs through it is to focus on the arduous journey of the Chinese Communists to seize the initiative of history and create historical great achievements, and point out the direction of struggle to create new glory in history. A century of great achievements is just a prelude. The journey of thousands of miles requires only creation and responsibility. (1) \"The time has come! The tide of the world is even more urgent!\" In 1919, the cry of the young Mao Zedong was deafening. The wheel of history is rolling forward, and the trend of the times is mighty. The Communist Party of China was nurtured in the historical trend of the victory of the October Revolution and the rise of socialism, and has become a trend-setter of the times. No matter how the situation and tasks change, no matter what kind of stormy waves it encounters, our party has always grasped the general trend of historical development, led the direction of historical development, took the initiative to act and forged ahead, and led the people to write the most magnificent epic in the history of the Chinese nation for thousands of years. . The century-long struggle of the party is a history that grasps the initiative of history and creates great achievements in history. It profoundly demonstrates the historical logic that history has created the Communist Party of China in the pursuit and struggle of the people, and the Communist Party of China has led the people to create new historical glory. . In the revolutionary era when the storm was dark, our party fought bloody and persevering, and became the backbone of the Chinese people's pursuit of national independence, people's liberation, national prosperity, and people's happiness. The history of the semi-feudal society has opened a new era of China's development; during the construction period, our party conformed to the general trend, united all parties, and led the people to become self-reliant and strive to become stronger in the new atmosphere of \"600 million Shenzhou\". The most extensive and profound social change in the history of the nation; the passionate reform years, based on the scientific judgment that \"peace and development are the two major issues in the contemporary world\", our party emancipated its mind, forged ahead, and made a move to shift the center of the work of the party and the state. When it comes to economic construction and the historic decision to implement reform and opening up, socialist China has made great strides to catch up with the times through a \"key move\"... The CPC Central Committee with self-confidence, self-improvement, integrity and innovation as the core, with great historical initiative, great political courage, and strong responsibility to take care of the overall situation at home and abroad, master the great struggle, the great project, the great cause, the great dream, and solve the problem. It has solved many problems that have long been wanted but not solved, accomplished many great things that were wanted but failed to do in the past, led the party and the country to achieve historic achievements and made historic changes in the new era, and provided the foundation for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. A more complete institutional guarantee, a more solid material foundation, and a more active spiritual force. With the courage and responsibility of \"not offending hundreds or thousands of corrupt elements, we must offend the 1.4 billion people\", we made the key choice of comprehensively and strictly governing the party. Strengthening in forging; scientifically grasp the laws of economic and social development, accurately grasp the changes in the main social contradictions, propose and promote the comprehensive implementation of new development concepts, accelerate the construction of new development patterns, and promote the fundamental transformation of development methods; continuously promote comprehensive deepening of reforms to breadth And in-depth march, Shenzhou Dadi has started a great change with great momentum and momentum. A complete, scientific and standardized institutional system with effective operation is gradually taking shape. The modernization level of the national governance system and governance capacity has been continuously improved, and the \"rule of China\" has been recreated. New advantages; vigorously carry forward the national spirit with patriotism as the core and the spirit of the times with reform and innovation as the core, clearly put forward the spiritual pedigree of the Chinese Communists with the great spirit of party building as the source, and actively cultivate and practice the socialist core values in the whole society , to forge a sense of community of the Chinese nation, to promote the creative transformation and innovative development of the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and to stand up the spiritual backbone of the new era; always firmly grasp the trend of the times and the general trend of the world, study the changes in the world, solve the problems of the times, and help all mankind Common values promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind and lead a new era of development of human civilization... Practice has fully proved that establishing Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party, and establishing the guiding position of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, reflects the whole Party. The common aspiration of the people of all ethnic groups in the entire army is the fundamental reason for China to overcome risks and challenges and achieve brilliant achievements in the new era. (2) It has been said that all nations are navigating \"the long river of time\". For thousands of years, the tides of history have ebb and flow, and the tragicomedy of the rise and fall of great powers has been staged repeatedly. History has taught people that whether a country can become prosperous and strong, or whether a nation can be rejuvenated, the most important thing is to see whether this country and this nation can conform to the trend of the times and take the initiative in the progress of history. \"Ask the vast land, who controls the ups and downs?\" An important reason for poverty and weakness in modern China is that the ruling clique follows the old ways, rests on its laurels, misses historical opportunities, and gradually falls into a passive situation of backwardness and beatings. After the Revolution of 1911, more than 300 political parties and political groups, large and small, appeared in China, most of which were short-lived. The big waves wash the sand, and the real gold is seen. In the surging river of history, a red boat set sail carrying the hope of the nation, crossed the rapids and rapids, passed through the stormy waves, and became the majestic giant ship that piloted China. \"Climb high and call for the mountains to respond, and from now on, China will not sink.\" The reason why history and the people choose the Communist Party of China is that the party has always stood at the forefront of the times, walked in the forefront of the times, and grasped the laws of historical development and The general trend, with unparalleled insight, leadership, control, and creativity, has become a strong leadership core for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Adhere to the leadership of the party, adhere to the supremacy of the people, adhere to theoretical innovation, adhere to independence, adhere to the Chinese road, adhere to the world, adhere to pioneering innovation, adhere to the courage to fight, adhere to the united front, adhere to self-revolution - the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China With a broad historical perspective and profound historical wisdom, the \"Ten Persistences\" deeply summarize the historical experience of the party's century-long struggle. These ten experience systems are complete, interconnected, and organically unified, further deepening the understanding of the laws governing the Communist Party, the laws of socialist construction, and the laws of the development of human society, and profoundly revealing the fundamental reason why the Party has always taken the initiative in history. \"The Chinese government has done far better than the governments of Western countries in representing the basic interests of ordinary people.\" As British writer and political commentator Carlos Martinez said, the West's two-party system or a multi-party system is essential. The above represent the interests of different groups of the bourgeoisie, and cannot represent the interests and wishes of all the people. The Communist Party of China represents the fundamental interests of the vast majority of the Chinese people, and has no special interests of its own. It has never been the spokesperson for any interest group, any powerful group, or any privileged class. The source of courage and confidence in all severe trials. The heart is selfless, so there is nothing to fear; the heart is the people, so it is brave to take responsibility; The most fundamental reason why our party can firmly grasp the initiative of history is that it has always been rooted in the broad masses of the people, stands on the right side of history, and stands on the side of human progress. , forging steel and iron bones that dare to fight and win. (3) In 1949, on the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Mao Zedong encouraged the whole party, \"The work of the past is just like the first step of the Long March.\" In 2021, on the occasion of the party's centennial birthday, General Secretary Xi Jinping solemnly announced that \"the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process.\" From the \"first step\" to the \"irreversible\", after going through difficulties and twists and turns, the human world is moving forward in the right way, and the historical coordinates of the national rejuvenation journey are clearer. \"Distinguishing position and regularity\". To grasp the initiative of history is to identify the historical position, see the general trend of history, set the direction of progress, strive to make plans according to the situation, act in accordance with the situation, and act in accordance with the situation, so as to be a leader, forge ahead, and fighter in the torrent of history. Today, the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics is a new historical juncture in my country's development. What kind of new era is this? For the Chinese nation, this is a new era ushering in a bright future for the realization of great rejuvenation; for scientific socialism, this is a new era in which the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics is held high in the world; for the Chinese people , this is a new era of united struggle, continuous creation of a better life, and gradual realization of common prosperity for all people; to the whole world, this is a new era of China's contribution of wisdom and solutions to human problems. All expectations and pursuits, explorations and struggles, accumulation and creation since modern times have converged in the new era, blossomed in the new era, and achieved success in the new era. The ancestors' historical vision of \"ascending China in the realm of prosperity and strength, and becoming a citizen of the land of happiness\", the lofty ambition of \"China should make a greater contribution to mankind\", \"everywhere are active creations, and everywhere is changing with each passing day.\" The beautiful vision of \"progress\" will get the most powerful answer in this era. The Chinese nation is in an era of greater than ever before, an era of continuous creation of great miracles that amaze the world. It is our luck to be born in a great era; it is our responsibility to make great achievements in a great era. On the new journey, the historical mission of our generation of Chinese Communists is to make unremitting efforts to realize the second centenary goal and realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. After a hundred years of wind and rain, the return is still a teenager; the original intention has not changed, and the struggle has no end... (4) According to data from the World Health Organization, as of December 21, the cumulative number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the world has exceeded 270 million, and the cumulative number of deaths has exceeded 5.3 million example. At the national and regional level, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the United States has exceeded 50 million, and the cumulative number of deaths has exceeded 800,000, ranking first in the world. At present, my country's 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have reported more than 2.7 billion doses of the new coronavirus vaccine, and the vaccination rate has reached more than 80%. The number of people who have completed the new coronavirus vaccination is the largest in the world. China has provided nearly 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations, making China the country that provides the most vaccines, contributing to bridging the \"immunity gap\". Considering this set of data carefully, it is quite emotional. In the fight against the epidemic, why has China won the initiative in the new era and brought light and hope to hundreds of millions of people and the international community? Only by decoding the \"political code\" behind the Chinese miracle can a convincing answer be found. In the face of the raging epidemic, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core firmly upholds the idea of putting people first and life first. From the decisive decision of Wuhan's \"closure of the city\", to the commanding of the three armies, the whole party's action, the national mobilization, to the scientific grasp of the dialectics of epidemic prevention and control and economic development, General Secretary Xi Jinping personally commanded and deployed, The party, government, military, people and the people have joined forces, and the east, west, south, north, and China have made great efforts to fight against the epidemic. my country has maintained a world-leading position in economic development and epidemic prevention and control, and has made important contributions to the global fight against the epidemic. In this vigorous struggle, the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has fully demonstrated the role of the \"Dinghai Shenzhen\", and the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics in concentrating on major tasks and solving difficult problems have become more prominent. Xi Jinping's socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era The power of the truth of thought is fully manifested. The wind and rain are unmoved and safe like a mountain, with a mainstay standing in the middle. Looking back on the party's century-long struggle, there are times of crisis and survival, resolute rise after setbacks, chaos after mistakes, and perseverance in the face of trials and tribulations. Why has our party always been undefeated or crushed? History and practice have profoundly shown that to grasp the initiative of history, we must have a strong leadership core and scientific theoretical guidance. This is the fundamental guarantee for our party to overcome all risks and challenges and continue to move from victory to victory. It is related to the future and destiny of the party and the country, the party and the The fundamental question of the success or failure of the people's cause. The century-old party history eloquently proves that if the party has a core, the party's cause will prosper; otherwise, it will stagnate or even regress. Continue to grasp the historical initiative on the new journey. The most fundamental thing is to adhere to the overall leadership of the party, especially the centralized and unified leadership of the party central committee, resolutely safeguard Comrade Xi Jinping's core position of the party central committee and the core position of the whole party, and unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics of Xi Jinping's new era. Socialist ideas as a guide to action. The ship is heavy, and there is only one person at the helm. The closer we get to the goal, the more severe the situation and the more arduous the task, the more we need a strong core of leadership to lead the whole party and the people across the country to cultivate new opportunities and open new opportunities. Firmly support and maintain the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping, the whole party will have the star, the people of the whole country will have the backbone, the China Fuxing ship will have the helm, and in the face of risks and challenges, it will be able to \"let the wind and waves rise, be stable.\" on a fishing boat\". A career guided by scientific theory has a bright future. Guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, our party will be able to stick to the right direction, scientifically grasp the law of development, ride the wind and waves without getting lost, set sail for a new journey, and lead more than 1.4 billion Chinese people to the The glorious shore of national rejuvenation. (5) Marx and Engels pointed out: \"Historical activities are the cause of the masses, and with the deepening of historical activities, the ranks of the masses will inevitably expand.\" Over the past century, under the banner of the party, the masses of the people have been the \"copper wall and iron wall\" against the enemy and bandits. \"The vast ocean\" is the \"iron man\" and \"screw\" of socialist revolution and construction, the \"pioneer\" and \"pioneering cow\" of reform and opening up, and the \"striver\" and \"dream chaser\" of the new era. On the historical stage of national rejuvenation, the people will always occupy the C position, and they are the well-deserved protagonists of this great historical drama. Today, pictures of rapid development, scenes of struggle with sweat, and impressive achievements that have attracted worldwide attention, all demonstrate the creative power of the people. Take a look at today's China, the people are more confident, self-reliant, and self-improving, greatly enhanced their ambition, backbone, and confidence, radiating unprecedented historical initiative and historical creativity, and they are writing the great history of China's development in the new era with confidence. The historical trend is surging due to the power of the people, and the youth of the times blooms in the struggle of the people. On the new journey, relying on the people to create new historical achievements, we must respect the people's dominant position and pioneering spirit, and further fully release the wisdom and strength contained in the people, stimulate the innovation vitality of the whole society, and allow the people to create a better life. The endogenous power burst out. The most important thing in the world is nothing more than the people's livelihood; the greatest thing in the world is nothing more than the people's hearts. All the struggles of our party are for the people to live a good life. \"Jiangshan is the people, and the people are the country.\" On the new journey, we will always maintain a pure heart for the people, always maintain flesh and blood ties with the people, understand and practice the people-centered development thinking, and further enhance the people's commitment to development. A sense of gain, happiness, and security can continue to bring together the powerful forces of hundreds of millions of people to unite and struggle. If you attack fortifications with this, you will not be destroyed; if you build a career with this, you will not succeed! (6) \"Jigang's four-meter-three production line, the last steel plate...\" The words written on the steel plate in a few lines reflect the Phoenix Nirvana road of Jinan Iron and Steel Group from \"relying on steel for food\" to \"developing from abandoned steel\". Facing the challenges of overcapacity and low efficiency, the company began a difficult transformation journey, shutting down all steel production lines, aiming at new materials, high-end equipment manufacturing and other industries to break through the situation, and finally broke into a new world. In today's China, there are still many stories of such difficulties and turning crises into opportunities. The ancients said: \"A wise person thinks about things, even if they are good, they must think about harm; although they do harm, they must think about what is good.\" Materialist dialectics tells us that danger and opportunity coexist, depend on each other, and can mutually support each other under certain conditions. transform. Taking the initiative in history means always having a strong sense of urgency and risk, constantly enhancing the ability to turn crises into opportunities and turning crises into safety, and always maintain an active and vigorous mental state, so as to promote the cause of the party and the people to move forward without hindrance. In today's world, peace and development are still the themes of the times, and the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind is increasingly gaining popularity. At the same time, the international environment is becoming more and more complex, instability and uncertainty have increased significantly. Under the impact of the epidemic of the century, the unprecedented changes in a century have accelerated, and the world has entered a period of turbulence and change. my country is in a critical period of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It has significant institutional advantages, improved governance efficiency, long-term economic growth, solid material foundation, strong development resilience, and a stable social situation. Continued development has many advantages and conditions. At the same time, we must be soberly aware that the problem of unbalanced and insufficient development in my country is still prominent, economic development is facing triple pressures of shrinking demand, supply shock, and weakening expectations, and the task of reform, development and stability is arduous and arduous. To continue to take the initiative in history on the new journey, we must dialectically understand and grasp the general trend at home and abroad, coordinate the overall strategy of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the great changes in the world unseen in a century, bravely sail the wind, take the uphill road, and strive to take advantage of the crisis. , to start a new game in a changing game. On the whole, my country's development is still in a period of important strategic opportunities that can make a lot of difference, and the times and trends are on our side. No matter how the international situation changes, we must unswervingly do our own thing well, grasp the \"master key\" of high-quality development, and continue to create opportunities and gain the initiative with our own development and growth. \"It's time to take advantage of the situation, and it's time to not lose it.\" There is no opportunity to wait, only the wonderful work done. To win the historical initiative, we must seize and make good use of the rare historical opportunity, grasp the overall situation of \"a game of chess\", make a good layout of \"first move chess\", and plan a \"winner chess\" to break the game. Calmness and tenacity, turning pressure into motivation, accumulating advantages into victory, overcoming difficulties and obstacles in hard work, and constantly writing new chapters of development. (7) \"What is a road? It is trampled on places where there is no road, and opened up from places where there are only thorns.\" China's revolution, construction, and reform have taken a road that has not been traveled by predecessors, and has no ready-made experience. can be copied. The party's struggle history tells us that to grasp the initiative of history is to always seek truth from facts, keep pace with the times, never become rigid, never stagnate, forge ahead in the pursuit of top and bottom, overcome difficulties in innovation and change, and constantly respond to the times creatively. The subject proposed, compose the magnificent epic of \"dare to teach the sun and the moon to change the new sky\". Promoting the unprecedented great cause cannot be accomplished without hard work and innovation. From promoting theoretical innovation based on practice, to promoting comprehensive innovation centered on scientific and technological innovation, from accelerating the construction of a new development pattern with domestic circulation as the main body and domestic and international dual circulation promoting each other, to promoting common prosperity in high-quality development ...On the new journey, new situations and new problems are emerging one after another, all of which call for Chinese Communists in the new era to stand up to the tide of the times, embrace the \"big man of the country\", take pioneering and innovation as a normal state, take new actions to open up new situations, and use new The excellent answer sheet responds to the questions of the times and the people. \"Changers are the nature of heaven and earth\". In today's world, the trend of change and innovation is rolling forward. Whoever rejects change or innovation will fall behind the times and be eliminated by history. In the face of new issues and new challenges, we must continue to seize the historical initiative in the new journey, and we need more vitality from reform and driving force from innovation. Only with the courage to emancipate the mind, the courage to take the lead, the courage to attack the city, the hardest bone, the most dangerous mountain, and the heaviest burden can we accurately recognize changes, respond scientifically, and actively seek changes. , to create more impressive miracles on earth.

At the end, the earnest admonition that \"the whole party should keep in mind the fundamental question of what the Chinese Communist Party is and what it is going to do\" is full of profound meaning and thought-provoking. A century is sharper than a thousand years, and the original intention shines on the journey. Standing on the peaks of the times, looking back at the footsteps of forging ahead, yesterday's suffering and glory have been written into the annals of history, today's mission is creating a new history, and tomorrow's great dream calls us to create a better future. There is no end in front of the struggler, only a new starting point. As we embark on a new journey to achieve the second centenary goal, let us unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, grasp the time and trend of China's development in the new era, and gather the hearts and strengths of hundreds of millions of Chinese people. We will strive to achieve the set goals with the persistence of insisting that the green mountains will not relax, and unremittingly promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with the sobriety of those who have traveled a hundred miles and ninety years, and win even greater victories and glory!

and opening a new situation\u3011 Photovoltaic can not only generate electricity, but also raise sheep - this is the magic of Tala Beach in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (hereinafter referred to as Hainan Prefecture) in Qinghai Province. Standing on the sightseeing tower of the State Power Investment Group Yellow River Upper Hydropower Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the Yellow River Company), the Talatan Ecological Photovoltaic Park has a panoramic view. The continuous photovoltaic panels are blue to the skyline, and they have created a \"Qinghai Lake\". Under the \"shelter\" of each photovoltaic panel, the former deserted beach has been turned into a pasture, and more than 2,000 sheep have been enjoying themselves on the ground, becoming a unique local scene. The desert Gobi and high-altitude ultra-long sunshine are unique advantages for photovoltaic power generation. In recent years, Qinghai has vigorously promoted the development of the photovoltaic industry in Gonghe County, Hainan Prefecture. The Talatan Ecological Photovoltaic Park covering an area of 609 square kilometers has become the largest photovoltaic power generation base in the world. \"It turns out that the land here is seriously desertified. Since the power station was built, the grass can grow up to raise sheep, and the income has also increased.\" Speaking of the changes in his hometown in the past few years, a herdsman in Tiegai Township, Gonghe County, Hainan Prefecture expressed emotion to Zhankui. As Xiang Zhankui said, with the coverage of photovoltaic panels, the surface evaporation is greatly reduced, the water is retained, and the vegetation is gradually restored. \"The data shows that the laying of photovoltaic panels reduces the wind speed in the park by nearly 50% and the evaporation by 30%, which is very beneficial to the restoration and growth of vegetation.\" said Huan Xingsheng, deputy director of the production technology department of Qinghai Yellow River Photovoltaic Inspection Co., Ltd. , The water used to clean the panels has a certain nourishing effect on the grass, coupled with the shielding properties of the photovoltaic panels themselves, the soil water-holding capacity is greatly improved, and the former barren land has been replaced with a new look. However, the longer the weeds, the better, it will block the photovoltaic panels and affect the power generation efficiency, and there will be a fire hazard in winter, so the power station mobilized the surrounding villagers to raise \"photovoltaic sheep\" here. In addition, the villagers are responsible for cleaning photovoltaic modules, mowing grass, etc., which also broadens their income channels. A power station can generate electricity, eat meat, control wind and sand, help the poor, and solve problems... This kind of complementary mode of animal husbandry and light is not only \"beautiful\" in economic and social benefits, but also endows the clean energy industry with richer connotations . Although photovoltaic power generation is good, it has problems of intermittency, volatility and randomness. To this end, the Yellow River Company has teamed up with relevant scientific research institutes to develop a \"water-light complementary\" coordinated operation control system to convert photovoltaic power generation into a safe and stable high-quality power supply. More than 40 kilometers away from the Talatan Ecological Photovoltaic Park is the Longyangxia Hydropower Station. Here, the \"water-solar complementary\" grid-connected photovoltaic power station is regarded as a new unit, which can further enhance the peak-shaving capacity of the hydropower station. In the opinion of industry experts, the \"water-solar complementation\" model not only improves the power quality of photovoltaic power generation, realizes the function of rapid compensation of hydropower and photovoltaic power generation, but also solves the problem of safe grid connection of photovoltaic power generation, which provides my country's development of clean energy. A new mode. In my country, there are still many projects such as \"water-solar complementary\" power generation in Longyangxia, which steadily promote technological innovation, so that green new energy can benefit the people. \"As of the end of 2020, the cumulative installed capacity of renewable energy power generation in my country was 934 million kilowatts, accounting for about 1/3 of the total installed capacity of renewable energy power generation in the world and 42.5% of the total installed power generation capacity in China, ranking first in the world for many consecutive years.\" According to Yi Yuechun, director of the Renewable Energy Information Management Center and vice president of the General Institute of Hydropower and Water Conservancy Planning and Design, the development and utilization of renewable energy in my country has achieved remarkable results in reducing pollution and carbon, effectively improving the local ecological environment and living environment, and contributing to ecological Civilization construction has made positive contributions.

Wuhan Metro Line 5, Line 6 Phase II, and Line 16 (Hannan Line) opened on the same day. So far, Wuhan has achieved full coverage of rail transit in the city, and the existing subway operation mileage has reached 435 kilometers, ranking first in mileage and scale in the central region. Wuhan Metro Line 5 is the first fully automatic driving line in Hubei. It is equipped with a domestic FAO fully automatic operation system with completely independent intellectual property rights. The train completes the whole process of wake-up inspection, main line operation, and sleep in the return field. \"There is no cab in the car, and the sense of technology is full!\" Through the huge glass at the head of the train, the scenery outside the car is unobstructed, which also amazed the citizen Sun Jingyue. During the visit, the reporter found that the front of the car is the most popular among passengers, where you can experience the \"time and space shuttle\" scene. Line 16, which was opened at the same time, is the first metro line along the river in Wuhan. It passes through three Yangtze River bridges. Among them, the viaduct along the Junshan section of the Yangtze River is more than 30 meters above the ground, and passengers can enjoy the beautiful scenery along the river. In addition, the top speed of Line 16 can reach 120 kilometers per hour, and it only takes 35 minutes for the train to run the entire 33 kilometers, making it the \"fastest\" subway line in Wuhan. The second phase of Line 6 has a total length of 7 kilometers, with a total of 5 stations, all of which are underground stations. It will be connected with the first phase of the project and become an important cross-regional cross-river rail transit backbone line. According to reports, the three subways opened to traffic on the same day, Wuhan Rail Transit added 75.2 kilometers of new line mileage and 42 stations at one time, the most since Wuhan started the construction of the first subway."}, {"date": "2021-12-26", "title":

media in the United States and the West should be cured", "en_text": "The spokesperson of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said in a statement on December 27 that some politicians and media in the United States and the West are obsessed with intolerant ideology, and they have shown obvious \"dementia\" on the Hong Kong issue. It is really sad! The spokesperson pointed out that some politicians and media in the United States and the West have taken it for granted that the United Kingdom has won democracy for Hong Kong, and the Chinese government will abolish democracy in Hong Kong. The fact is: regardless of the fact that the United Kingdom did not give Hong Kong democracy during the century and a half of its colonial rule in Hong Kong, the Sino-British Joint Declaration does not contain the words \"democracy\" and \"universal suffrage\" at all. The entire contents are contained in the relevant annexes only in the form of a unilateral statement by the Chinese government. Regarding the ultimate goal of universal suffrage for the Chief Executive and all members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, it is a provision that the Chinese government proactively made while considering the overall long-term development of the country and Hong Kong when formulating the Basic Law of Hong Kong. The so-called \"dual universal suffrage\" claim that the United Kingdom fought for Hong Kong is completely false! Don't they know the historical facts written in black and white? The spokesperson pointed out that some politicians and media in the US and the West take it for granted that the anti-China rioters in Hong Kong are striving for democracy, and the Chinese government is politically suppressing them. The fact is: the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China made a decision as early as 2007, clarifying that the election of Hong Kong's fifth chief executive in 2017 can be carried out by universal suffrage. In 2014, it confirmed and clarified the system of universal suffrage for the chief executive. several core elements, thus paving the way for universal suffrage of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. It is precisely because the anti-China rioters in Hong Kong have tried their best to prevent the goal of universal suffrage for the Chief Executive from being achieved as scheduled, and Hong Kong's democratic development has suffered repeated setbacks. Moreover, these anti-China and Hong Kong rioters are anti-democracy under the guise of \"democracy\", and have committed crimes and even violence and terror in order to achieve their sinister political goals. He was punished because he violated the law and was held accountable according to the law, which has nothing to do with \"political suppression\". When the situation is so clear, can they not see it? The spokesperson pointed out that some politicians and media in the United States and the West have taken it for granted that the national security law for Hong Kong has been abused to restrict Hong Kong's freedom and human rights, which has damaged Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The fact is that the Hong Kong National Security Law targets a very small number of criminals who seriously endanger national security, and protects the vast majority of law-abiding people. So far, only more than 150 people have been detained in Hong Kong on suspicion of violating the national security law. In a safe environment, the freedom and human rights of the majority of Hong Kong residents and international people in Hong Kong have been better protected. Now, Hong Kong's development is back on track, social order has been restored, and business conditions are improving day by day. Hong Kong's financial market remained stable and orderly, and deposits in the banking system continued to rise. In the first 11 months of this year, the average daily turnover of Hong Kong stocks increased by 34% year-on-year. Foreign chambers of commerce, including the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, have expressed optimism about Hong Kong's future. The signal is so strong that they can't hear it? The spokesperson pointed out that some politicians and media in the United States and the West have taken it for granted that Hong Kong's new electoral system is to exclude dissidents and pursue \"uniformity\". But the fact is: the new electoral system excludes only those anti-China rioters. Hong Kong residents who conform to the principle of \"patriots ruling Hong Kong\" have the opportunity to participate. In the just-concluded 7th Legislative Council election in Hong Kong, the backgrounds of the candidates are unprecedentedly diverse, including business and professional elites, grassroots labor representatives, native Hong Kongers, and immigrants from the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Foreign residents, both seasoned \"veterans\" and energetic newcomers, and the final nomination confirmed candidates come from different political groups, political factions, represent different political spectrums, hold different political ideas and aspirations , is the real \"colorful\". Right and wrong are so clear that they can't tell the difference? The spokesman pointed out that it is not difficult to grasp the historical facts, and it is not difficult to find the truth. The White Paper \"Democratic Development in Hong Kong under \"One Country, Two Systems\" recently published by the Information Office of the State Council comprehensively reviewed the emergence and development of Hong Kong's democracy with a large number of facts and detailed data, and clarified in depth the central government's principled stance on Hong Kong's democratic development. It is suggested that politicians and media in the United States and the West can take a look and learn to speak with facts. Finally, the spokesperson emphasized that Hong Kong is an important window connecting China with the world. The long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong is not only beneficial to China, but also to other countries that have many interests in Hong Kong.

Yahui) On December 24, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a conference on the tracking and handling of key proposals in Beijing and Zhengzhou by video, and continued to promote the proposal handling of \"refined airspace management reform\" to achieve new results. Qi Jianguo, Deputy Director of the Proposal Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Li Jian, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former Deputy Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China attended the venue in Beijing; Guo Gengmao, Deputy Director of the Proposal Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Fei Dongbin, Member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor, Zhou Chunyan, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Secretary-General Wang Zhongshan attended the meeting in Henan. Fei Dongbin introduced the overall situation of airspace management and civil aviation development in our province. The responsible comrades of the Henan Air Traffic Control Branch of Civil Aviation and Henan Airport Group introduced the relevant situation of our province. The responsible comrades of the Office of the National Air Traffic Control Commission, the Air Traffic Management Industry Management Office of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, and the Office of the Beijing Regional Air Traffic Control Coordination Committee made speeches, and everyone had an in-depth exchange and put forward opinions and suggestions. In his speech, Qi Jianguo summarized the experience in handling proposals. He pointed out that under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, all parties have cooperated closely to promote the reform of refined airspace management and achieved remarkable results. The structure of low-altitude airspace has been continuously optimized, and the pilot program of low-altitude airspace reform has achieved phased results. In view of the problems that still need to be solved in Henan, it is necessary to further establish the concept of air traffic control as a service, improve the military-civilian coordination mechanism, promote the reform of low-altitude airspace management, improve the efficiency of airspace use in the Central Plains, boost the development of civil unmanned aerial vehicles, and speed up Nanyang The airport relocation work provides high-quality air traffic control services for the economic and social development of Henan and the whole country. Guo Gengmao pointed out when presiding over the meeting that substantial progress has been made in the reform of refined airspace management through continuous tracking and supervision.

I hope that Longgang will make good plans on the important undeveloped land in the east of Shenzhen, and the industry should focus on low-carbon, zero-carbon, and negative carbon, and advance steadily in an orderly and rhythmic manner.\" Zhu Liyang, President of China Circular Economy Association, said at the seminar on \"Carbon Road Pioneer, Longgang First\". From December 16th to 17th, at the 2021 Carbon Peak Carbon Neutral Forum and the 9th Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City Forum, Longgang District officially announced to the outside world the \"Overall Plan for Energy Conservation and Carbon Reduction in Longgang District\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Plan\") and the \"Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City Comprehensive Development Plan\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Plan\"). This is the first district-level \"double carbon\" top-level design in Shenzhen. \"We strive to reach a peak in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and strive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.\" This is China's solemn commitment to the world. Longgang's \"dual carbon\" exploration came earlier than the trend of the times, and \"Carbon Road Pioneer\" can be described as an accurate summary of its green development path. As early as 2011, Longgang District took the initiative to take the \"examination paper\" and planned to build a demonstration carrier of green and low-carbon development in eastern Shenzhen - Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City. Over the past ten years, Longgang District has adhered to the original intention of low-carbon, green and sustainable development, and integrated low-carbon green into urban planning and construction, industry introduction, transportation layout, people's livelihood and other aspects, and the industrial energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of GDP is low. To 0.073 tons of standard coal/10,000 yuan, leading the country, and won the title of \"the fourth batch of national ecological civilization construction demonstration areas\" and \"the first batch of carbon neutral pilot demonstration areas in the province\". Since the beginning of this year, Longgang has made frequent moves in low-carbon development. In the strategy of \"one core, two cores and multiple fulcrums\", Longgang has laid out the \"low-carbon intelligent core\" of East Nuclear, and clarified the industrial development idea of \"IT+BT+low-carbon\". Practices such as hydrogen energy buses, zero-carbon parks, and near-zero-carbon and sustainable development demonstration communities convey the concept of low-carbon culture to the public in urban life. Starting from the release of the \"Double Carbon\" New Deal, Longgang is fully rolling out the \"Double Carbon\" chess game, reshaping the logic of urban development with \"low carbon\". Facing the future, Longgang strives to become a national demonstration area of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality pilot construction, creating a Longgang model of green and sustainable development in industrial areas, and providing a new model of green and low-carbon development in industrial areas that can be replicated and promoted. \u25cfNangfang Daily trainee reporter Liu Yueya pays equal attention to top-level design development and emission reduction \"Standing at a new historical starting point, we officially release the 'double carbon' new policy here, announcing to the whole society that Longgang will take a green, low-carbon and high-quality development path The new appearance of these two documents marks a new solid step in Longgang\u2019s green and low-carbon development strategy.\u201d Gu Gengjun, Member of the Standing Committee of Longgang District Committee and Deputy District Chang, at the launch ceremony of the Low-Carbon New Deal in Longgang District said. At present, Longgang has ranked first among the top 100 industrial areas in China for three consecutive years. The experience of how to carry out low-carbon transformation in strong industrial areas across the country has reference value and reference significance for domestic industrial cities and industrial urban areas. Achieving the \"dual carbon\" goal is a broad and profound economic and social transformation. Top-level design is indispensable for the tough battle to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. The two new policy documents released this time are the result of many experts in Longgang District who have learned from top-level external brain wisdom. In order to explore useful ideas for low-carbon and green development in urban areas, in March this year, the Longgang District Party Committee and the District Government organized a delegation to Beijing to invite 10 top domestic experts in the fields of low-carbon energy, resources and environment, and green finance as Longgang District to deal with climate change. Special consultant, established the first low-carbon think tank team to promote the low-carbon development of Longgang District. In November, Longgang District held an expert consultation meeting to listen to the insights of top experts on the construction and development of Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City. The \"14th Five-Year Plan\" is a critical period and a window period for carbon peaking, and Longgang has also reached a stage of green development to a new level. According to the \"Guidelines for Carbon Emissions Accounting for Carbon Peaking in Guangdong Province (Interim)\" and \"Guangdong Province's Prefectural-level City Carbon Peaking Implementation Plan Compilation Outline\", the carbon dioxide emissions in Longgang District have entered the peak plateau period, showing a trend of rising first and then falling. It is just the right time for Longgang to introduce a programmatic guideline for the green and low-carbon development of the whole region. According to the \"Plan\", by 2025, Longgang plans to basically complete the transformation of economic and social green and low-carbon development, becoming a leader in the decoupling of economic growth and carbon emissions, and a pioneer area for carbon peaking in China; by 2030, it will become an industrial area with green and low-carbon development. A model of Longgang, providing replicable and operational Longgang experience to the whole country; taking the lead in building a carbon-neutral demonstration zone in an all-round way in China. Compare the timetable and develop a roadmap. Longgang proposed 10 low-carbon measures, covering low-carbon industries, green buildings, green transportation, livable environment, etc., and fully implement the green and low-carbon concept in the construction of economic, political, cultural, social and ecological civilization. . From the content of the \"Plan\", Longgang attaches great importance to handling the relationship between development and carbon reduction, and the ideas of scientific development and scientific carbon reduction run through it. For example, \"promoting the formation of agglomeration of biomedicine, green and low-carbon industries\" and \"building a low-carbon intelligent manufacturing agglomeration\" have clarified the transformation direction of the industrial zone. Contents such as \"promoting the intelligent transformation of traditional industries\", \"comprehensively popularizing and promoting green and low-carbon methods\", and \"building a comprehensive system of smart energy and transportation\" demonstrate the responsibility and responsibility of the industrial zone under the commitment of \"carbon reduction\". The system transformation will reshape the development logic with \"low carbon\" and a new vision is ahead, and the roadmap has been released. The release of the \"Plan\" is an important turning point for Longgang's plan to change from an active participant in the \"Double Carbon\" to a key leader. \"The 'two-carbon' goal proposed by China is not a straight-line subtraction, but a systematic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\" \"To achieve the 'two-carbon' goal, we must prevent one-size-fits-all, and also prevent poor transformation.\" The word \"low carbon\" is hot, and the industry Experts have repeatedly pointed out that in the process of realizing the \"dual carbon\" goal, it is not just a simple issue of energy conservation and emission reduction, but a problem of development mode. Over the years, Longgang has systematically promoted the low-carbon transformation of economic and social development, and practiced a set of \"addition, subtraction, multiplication and division\" methods to achieve the \"double carbon\" goal. Policy \"plus\" code to help green development. Since the beginning of this year, the low-carbon industry has been listed as a pillar industry in the region alongside electronic information communication and biological medicine to be cultivated and built. The \"East Core\" low-carbon intelligent manufacturing core will form a consortium of Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City and Powerlong Science and Technology City, and will closely combine green low-carbon and intelligent manufacturing to promote the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. The Seventh Party Congress of Longgang District proposed the implementation of the green and low-carbon industry expansion plan. In the future, it will cultivate and introduce a number of leading enterprises in the green and low-carbon industry to build a low-carbon industry cluster. Solid waste \"reduction\" to promote low-carbon transformation. The data shows that the energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of GDP of the above-scale industries in Longgang District is as low as 0.073 tons of standard coal per 10,000 yuan, leading the country; .5 dropped to 20.4 micrograms/cubic meter, meeting the World Health Organization's second-stage standard, and was awarded the titles of \"The Fourth Batch of National Ecological Civilization Construction Demonstration Zones\" and \"the Province's First Batch of Carbon Neutral Pilot Demonstration Zones\". Industrial agglomeration releases the \"multiplier\" effect. This year, Longgang accelerated the introduction of green and low-carbon industrial resources, signed a strategic cooperation agreement with State Power Investment Group Guangdong Electric Power Co., Ltd., and signed contracts with 9 outstanding enterprises in green and low-carbon industries, with a total investment of over 50 billion yuan in one fell swoop; (Shenzhen) Urban Underground Space and Energy Research Institute cooperated to build a demonstration park for comprehensive utilization of geothermal energy in an international low-carbon city, accumulating momentum for promoting the expansion of the low-carbon industry matrix. Energy utilization \"removes\" the old for the new. Longgang opened and operated the city's first hydrogen energy bus demonstration line; became the city's only approved \"national county (district) rooftop distributed photovoltaic development pilot\"; built the world's largest single plant, the highest flue gas emission standard, and daily processing of 5,000 domestic wastes Tons of Shenzhen Eastern Environmental Protection Power Plant completely ended the history of domestic waste landfill disposal. These series of achievements have made Longgang's green and low-carbon development path shining brightly. In the future, Longgang will adhere to the concept of high-quality development and integrate the concept of green and low-carbon into the planning and layout, urban construction, industrial development, life guidance and other aspects of the region. A high-quality urban area with lower energy consumption, more beautiful environment and better ecology is emerging. into reality. Building a benchmark for an all-round test of green development \"We must continue to polish the brand of Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City, adhere to a high-level position to promote the construction of an international low-carbon city, and make a low-carbon city development plan with a global vision and international standards.\"16 At the main forum of the opening ceremony in Japan, China's special envoy for climate change, Xie Zhenhua, sent a message to Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City. \"Since the first session, I have participated in the Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City Forum. This forum has driven and promoted Shenzhen's work in promoting the green and low-carbon development of clean energy over the years.\" Shi Dinghuan, former counselor of the State Council, said in an online speech. After a lapse of three years, the main forum of the 9th International Low-Carbon City Forum has returned to the main venue of Longgang, and the public's attention has once again focused on the venue of the forum - Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City. No less than the first forum, it has met \"old friends\" online and offline thousands of miles. Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City is the main position of \"low-carbon intelligent core\" in the \"one core, two cores and multiple fulcrums\" in Longgang District. The area is rich in mountains and water resources and has a superior ecological background. The concept of sponge city construction runs through the entire process of urban planning, construction and operation, and a number of demonstration projects with very low-carbon connotations have been built. After 10 years of development and exploration, Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City has gained a good reputation at home and abroad, and has accumulated a rich practical foundation in the green and low-carbon field. Since 2013, Longgang has held 5 main forums and 3 sub-forums of the \"Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City Forum\". 5,500 guests from more than 60 countries and international organizations gathered here to speak freely and collide with wisdom. Signing contracts for important projects. Since the beginning of this year, Longgang District has adopted measures such as building a large integration of one square kilometer at a high level, using more than 100 advanced low-carbon technologies to transform and upgrade venues, planning to hold green and low-carbon salons, introducing the 6th Climate Film and Television Conference, and strengthening low-carbon top-level planning and design. , mobilize the power of the whole region to prepare for the 9th International Low-Carbon City Forum, and strive to gather low-carbon profound wisdom and build a national carbon diplomacy platform. After returning and starting again, Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City has a new mission of \"upgrading\". Longgang has newly compiled the \"Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City Comprehensive Development Plan\", with a higher position, wider vision and more practical measures, to provide the area with scientific and technological innovation, industrial system, regional cooperation, development mode, green energy, etc. A plan has been formulated for the realization of the upgrade. The \"Planning\" gives Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City the overall positioning of building China's carbon peak and carbon neutral pilot demonstration area. Green and Low-Carbon Action Leading Zone\u201d. By 2025, it will become a demonstration model for the green and high-quality development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area; by 2030, it will become a national benchmark for the country to demonstrate the fruitful achievements of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Build a low-carbon technology and industry center, create a dense and dense low-carbon urban form, build a panoramic green and resilient infrastructure, and build a low-carbon innovation exchange platform in the Bay Area... From the content of the \"Planning\", it can be foreseen that Longgang will be here in the future. On the land with a total planned area of about 53 square kilometers, an all-round test of green development will be carried out. The \"Planning\" proposes that in the next step, the International Low-Carbon City will make every effort to promote 8 key actions, create a national model for coordinating low-carbon emissions and high-quality development, and explore a path for emission reduction and carbon reduction suitable for megacities in Shenzhen and even the whole country. . By that time, low-carbon scientific and technological achievements full of science and technology will be transformed here, residents will enjoy a green and healthy lifestyle, and \"carbon inclusiveness\" will lead the new trend of green life. The internationally influential low-carbon exchange platform attracts visitors from all over the world. \u25a0Link the ten measures of the \"General Plan for Energy Conservation and Carbon Reduction in Longgang District\" to optimize the allocation of space resources, promote the intelligent transformation of the industry, fully tap clean energy elements, create a comprehensive system of smart energy + transportation, strengthen the demonstration effect of buildings with near-zero carbon energy consumption, and build a green and low-carbon recycling industry Systematically promote the high-standard planning and construction of an international low-carbon city, focus on the optimization of landscape and ecology, fully implement a green and low-carbon life, and carry out multi-level low-carbon pilot construction.

"en_text": "With ratification by governments, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) will come into force on January 1, 2022. With the final implementation of RCEP, the regional trade rules among RCEP member countries will be effectively integrated, the business environment within the region will be greatly optimized, and a unified large internal market will be realized. RCEP will not only help reduce the institutional transaction costs of intra-regional trade and investment in East Asia, and inject new impetus into the regional and even world economy, but will also become an important platform for my country to build a new development pattern, further promoting my country's implementation of rules, regulation and management. , standards and other fields of institutional opening. An important platform for building a higher-level open economy It is China's current overall development policy to promote the formation of a new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the mainstay and the domestic and international dual cycles promoting each other. After the implementation of RCEP, it will become a new important platform for my country to build a new development pattern. According to statistics, in 2020, my country's exports to RCEP member countries reached US$700.7 billion, accounting for 27% of my country's total exports that year; imports from RCEP member countries reached US$777.9 billion, accounting for 37.8% of my country's total imports that year; my country absorbed 10% of foreign direct investment also comes from RCEP member countries. On the one hand, RCEP will expand market access, reduce transaction costs, and bring larger-scale, larger-scale, higher-quality products to businesses and consumers by pushing member countries to cut tariffs on trade in goods by 90% and ultimately achieve zero tariffs, as well as slashing non-tariff barriers. Lower-cost technologies, commodities and services can better meet the needs of enterprises' production and operation and the people's better life, and smooth the domestic circulation. On the other hand, after the implementation of RCEP, along with the implementation of trade and investment facilitation measures such as rules of origin, customs procedures, inspection and quarantine, and technical standards, the business environment within the region will be greatly optimized, and China and other member states will be enhanced and coordinated. It will help my country better integrate into regional and global industrial chains, value chains and supply chain networks, promote domestic and international dual circulation, and achieve high-quality economic development. The Peterson Institute for International Economics predicts that by 2030, RCEP is expected to increase China's exports by US$248 billion and economic growth by US$100 billion, 5.0% and 0.4% higher than the baseline, respectively. RCEP is an important platform for building a higher-level open economy. The Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to speed up the implementation of the free trade zone strategy. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Nineteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to implement the free trade zone upgrading strategy and build a high-standard free trade zone network facing the world. After the implementation of RCEP, China will not only establish free trade relations with Japan for the first time, increasing the number of my country's free trade partners to 26, but also increase China's free trade coverage to 35%, which means that in the future, my country will have more than 1/1/2 of the country's free trade partners. 3 The import and export trade has been systematically guaranteed. At present, with the value chain trade and the fourth industrial revolution, the global trade system has entered a new round of reconstruction, and international economic and trade rules are being extended from border measures to measures within the border. RCEP aims to achieve a modern, comprehensive, high-quality and reciprocal free trade agreement, which not only involves traditional trade in goods, rules of origin, etc., but also incorporates new topics such as intellectual property rights, e-commerce, competition policy, and government procurement. Among them, my country's commitment to opening up trade in services has reached the highest level of existing free trade agreements. For the first time, China has made commitments in the field of investment in the form of a negative list in a free trade agreement, and promised to grant other member states pre-establishment national treatment; for the first time in a free trade agreement Include intellectual property clauses fully in China; for the first time, digital trade rules such as data flow and information storage have been included in free trade agreements. After the RCEP takes effect, it will effectively promote my country's benchmarking of international high-level economic and trade rules, accelerate the transformation of the opening of commodity factors to the institutional opening of rules, regulations, management, and standards, and form a new opening to the outside world in a wider range, wider field, and deeper level. pattern, and promote the construction of a new system of a higher-level open economy. Reduce institutional transaction costs and help regional economic development At present, RCEP member countries have reached 27 free trade agreements and 44 bilateral investment agreements, which stipulate different tariff concession arrangements, rules of origin and other different terms. Overlapping trade rules have cluttered the intraregional trade system, leading to the \u201cspaghetti bowl effect\u201d that increases transaction costs for firms. After the implementation of RCEP, it can not only provide a unified tariff reduction arrangement for more than 90% of trade in goods, but also draw on the successful experience of China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement upgrade negotiation, and greatly increase the application ratio of selective rules of origin to 65.8%. This increases the convenience and flexibility of the rules of origin. In addition, RCEP has also introduced rules such as the principle of accumulation in the area of origin and the self-declaration of the certificate of origin, which is expected to reduce the transaction cost of enterprises using RCEP preferential tariffs. More importantly, RCEP promotes and encourages member states to strengthen cooperation in customs procedures and trade facilitation, standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, trade in services, investment, e-commerce, etc., to further improve the level of facilitation and reduce institutionalization. transaction cost. UNCTAD pointed out that RCEP will reduce transaction costs and provide important opportunities for the region to attract foreign direct investment, especially compared with other regions, internal mutual investment among RCEP member countries only accounts for 30% of all foreign direct investment, still There is more room for growth. With the further adjustment of globalization, East Asia, with RCEP member states as the main body, has become a global value chain trade center that keeps pace with North America and Europe. However, the development of the region faces short-term impacts from the negative impact of the epidemic and long-term constraints from insufficient internal final consumption. In 2022, RCEP member countries will start the tariff reduction process for trade in goods, most of which will be tariff-free immediately or within 10 years. In the field of trade in services, the level of openness of each member state is higher than the level of the respective \"10+1\" agreement, covering many important fields such as finance, telecommunications, transportation, tourism, education, etc., and will all be turned into a negative list within 6 years of entry into force. Further improve the level of openness. In the field of investment, member states have made a high-level commitment to openness to non-service investment by adopting a negative list approach, which will greatly enhance policy transparency. After the RCEP is fully implemented, it will drive nearly one-third of the world's economic volume to form a unified large internal market, enhance the stability of economic and trade policies in East Asia, enhance positive investment expectations, boost production and consumption confidence, and help promote economic growth. The region and even the world provide a final consumer market that is different from traditional European and American markets, which will inject new impetus into regional and even world economic growth. A recent study by the Asian Development Bank shows that by 2030, RCEP is expected to drive exports of member countries by US$514 billion and economic growth by US$263 billion, which are 5.2% and 0.6% higher than the baseline, respectively. Deepening and world economic development create more final demand and greater development momentum. Adhere to open regionalism and improve global economic governance China has repeatedly emphasized that to promote regional economic integration, we must adhere to open regionalism. RCEP does not aim to establish a closed exclusive trade bloc, but adheres to high standards of moderation, non-discrimination and inclusiveness, and advocates open regionalism while ensuring that the number of member states is controllable. Specifically, the openness of RCEP is reflected in many aspects. For example, RCEP practices true multilateralism, adheres to inclusiveness without exclusion, integration without decoupling, exclusion of any country from joining, and does not pre-set entry thresholds and conditions; RCEP highly emphasizes trade and investment facilitation and economic and technological cooperation, and policy implementation The spillover effect is very significant. The policy dividend is not only limited to member countries, but also optimizes the regional business environment. The greater flexibility and comfort shown by RCEP can better meet the supply chain and innovation needs of each member, and is expected to be more effective in goods. In the fields of trade, service trade, investment and rules, achieve a balance of interests among economies at different levels of development in the region; RCEP adopts a step-by-step, step-by-step approach to continuously upgrade market access and economic and trade rules to ensure the openness and high quality of the agreement . It can be seen that RCEP fully embodies the greatest common divisor of the development demands of member states, and will guide economic globalization towards a more open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win direction. In the face of emerging global problems and challenges, we should adhere to openness, inclusiveness, consultation and cooperation, uphold and maintain multilateralism, and actively promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. Historical experience shows that only by fully considering and balancing inclusiveness, diversity and flexibility can the process of regional economic integration be effectively promoted. RCEP is a new attempt by China and other East Asian member states to participate in the regional trade and investment cooperation mechanism. It helps to promote the formulation of economic governance rules in emerging fields in a balanced and inclusive manner, and contributes new ideas and new solutions to improve participation in the reform of the global economic governance system. It will become a new milestone leading the reform and improvement of the global economic governance system.

"[Guangming Forum] The \"Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the major achievements and historical experience of the party's century-old struggle\" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: \"Now, the party unites and leads the Chinese people on the road to realize the second century of struggle. The goal is a new way to take the test. The times are the testers, we are the answerers, and the people are the testers. We must continue to get good grades in the test and show new looks and new actions in the new era and new journey.\" This is in \"two At the historical meeting point of the goal of \"a hundred years\", our party summed up the history, grasped the present, and looked forward to the future. Realizing the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has beautiful and lofty goals and arduous and arduous tasks. We need to take advantage of the situation, make persistent efforts, and strive to take the road of \"taking the test\" in the new era. \"Crushing for the exam\" is of special and important significance to the 100-year history of the Communist Party of China. It vividly shows the struggle attitude of the Communist Party of China to fulfill its original mission, to lay a foundation for a career, and to create a brilliant future. To a certain extent, the mental state of always \"taking the test\" on the road is the successful password for us to achieve one great victory after another and hand over one excellent answer sheet after another. At the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized: \"In the past 100 years, the Communist Party of China has handed over an excellent answer sheet to the people and history. Now, the Communist Party of China has united and led the Chinese people to embark on a journey of realization. The second centenary goal is a new way to take the exam.\" Different times have different connotations. In the new era and new journey, we must grasp the significance and connotation requirements of the era of \"rushing for the test\", strive to develop, move forward bravely, and continue to write a new chapter of \"rushing for the test\". Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the historic achievements and historical changes of the cause of the party and the country lie in the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, and in the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The Party has established Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party, and establishes the guiding position of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. It is of decisive significance for advancing the historical process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. On the new road of \"taking the test\", we must strengthen the \"four consciousness\", strengthen the \"four self-confidence\", achieve \"two maintenance\", and truly transform the \"two establishment\" into the idea of \"two maintenance\" Consciously, politically, consciously, move forward in unity. The successful experience in the past is the magic weapon for continued success in the future. Over the past 100 years, the Party has led the people in a great struggle, making breakthroughs in progress, rising up in setbacks, improving from summarizing, and accumulating valuable historical experience. The \"Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the major achievements and historical experience of the party's century-old struggle\" profoundly summarizes the historical experience of our party's century-old struggle: adhere to the party's leadership, adhere to the people's supremacy, adhere to theoretical innovation, adhere to independence, adhere to the Chinese road, adhere to the world , insist on pioneering and innovating, insist on daring to fight, adhere to the united front, and insist on self-revolution. These \"Ten Persistences\" are valuable experience accumulated through long-term practice, and spiritual wealth jointly created by the party and the people. On the road to the new \"examination\", we must cherish and persist for a long time, and continue to enrich and develop in the practice of the new era. Strong ability and high quality are the key and guarantee for good results in the test. On the new road of \"taking the test\", difficulties, risks and challenges from various aspects will definitely continue to appear. The key depends on whether we have the ability to overcome them, overcome them and control them. All comrades in the party, especially leading cadres at all levels, should have a sense of crisis that their skills are insufficient, and they should constantly enhance their skills with the spirit of time and time. Only when the ability of the whole party is continuously enhanced can the goal of the second century of struggle be realized, and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation can come true. At present, the first centenary goal has been successfully achieved, and the realization of the second centenary goal also requires the whole party to have a deep understanding of and effectively overcome the danger of lack of ability, and constantly improve learning skills, political leadership skills, reform and innovation skills, scientific development skills, and governance according to law.

"The Hebei civil affairs system resolutely fulfilled its political responsibility to ensure the bottom line, continuously reformed and improved the social assistance system, continued to promote the effective connection between the consolidation and expansion of poverty alleviation achievements and rural revitalization, and better guarantee the basic life of the people in need. Create a multi-level assistance system. Basic living assistance policies such as subsistence allowances and extreme poverty have been effectively implemented. Up to now, the province has guaranteed a total of 1.679 million urban and rural subsistence allowances and 256,000 urban and rural poor supporters. Implement the temporary assistance reserve fund system for townships (sub-districts), and provide emergency assistance to people who encounter sudden and temporary difficulties in a timely manner. Through government purchase of services, signing of care and nursing agreements, etc., visits and care services are provided for the elderly, minors, and disabled people in social assistance families, forming a \"material + service\" assistance method. A total of 970 million yuan has been raised by 192 social assistance foundations at the provincial, municipal and county levels. So far, a total of 1,916 people have been rescued and more than 8.7 million yuan has been spent. Improve the social assistance system. Policy documents such as the Measures for the Identification of Families with Minimum Living Allowances in Hebei Province, the Measures for the Identification of Extremely Poor Persons in Hebei Province, and the Implementation Plan for Improving the Mechanism for Establishing and Dynamic Adjustment of Minimum Living Security Standards for Urban and Rural Residents were issued. The province's urban and rural subsistence allowances averaged 711 yuan per month and 5,573 yuan per person per year, respectively. Consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation. Documents such as the \"Implementation Plan on Consolidating and Expanding the Achievements of Poverty Alleviation in the Field of Civil Affairs and Effectively Connecting with Rural Revitalization\" and other documents were issued to strengthen the monitoring of key populations such as those who were not included in the scope of basic guarantees and those who were prone to return to poverty. \"The \"missing guarantee\" and so on have resulted in a large-scale return to poverty. Up to now, among the 2.234 million people lifted out of poverty in the province, 785,000 people have been covered by social assistance, accounting for 35%. Strengthen dynamic monitoring of low-income population. A low-income population database has been preliminarily established. In addition to subsistence allowances and people in extreme poverty, it also includes 479,000 people at the edge of subsistence allowances, 45,000 people who are unstable in poverty alleviation, 56,000 people who are prone to poverty at the edge, and accidents caused by disasters and accidents. The population of 40,000 people with sudden and severe difficulties has laid a solid foundation for the development of dynamic monitoring of low-income population and normalized assistance."},

Council, and head of the leading group for promoting the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, presided over a plenary meeting of the leading group for promoting the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt on the 23rd. The spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the deployment of the Central Economic Work Conference, reviewed relevant documents, and studied and deployed key tasks to promote the high-quality development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. Han Zheng said that in recent years, relevant departments and provinces and cities along the Yangtze River have conscientiously implemented the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and have achieved phased results in promoting the ecological and environmental protection of the Yangtze River, and the achievements are worthy of full recognition. In the next step, we must fully, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development concept, firmly grasp the strategic orientation of focusing on large-scale protection and not engaging in large-scale development, adhere to the problem-oriented work method, and use key breakthroughs to drive the overall work to advance in a strong, orderly and effective manner. Promote the high-quality development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. Han Zheng emphasized that it is necessary to formulate the land and space planning of the Yangtze River with high quality and form a useful and operable \"base map\". It is necessary to do a good job in the prevention and control of water pollution and the restoration of water ecology, do a good job in the \"ten-year fishing ban\" in the Yangtze River, strengthen the protection of river and lake shorelines, and explore the establishment of a mechanism for realizing the value of ecological products. It is necessary to speed up the construction of the golden waterway of the Yangtze River, promote the \"four standardizations\" of management of waterways, ships, ports and customs clearance, and vigorously develop multimodal transport. It is necessary to strengthen the coordinated development of urban and rural areas, and plan the coordinated development of industries. It is necessary to promote high-level opening to the outside world, strengthen the leading role of the Yangtze River Delta, improve the level of opening up in the middle and upper reaches, and deeply integrate into the \"Belt and Road\" construction. It is necessary to strengthen investigation and research, and effectively improve the pertinence and effectiveness of solving problems. Liu He, Li Qiang, Chen Min'er, and He Lifeng attended the meeting, and members of the Leading Group to Promote the Development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the Office of the Leading Group and the responsible comrades of relevant departments attended the meeting. The meeting was held in the form of a video and teleconference, with branch venues set up in 11 provinces and cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt.

Each mark is a police force corresponding to an administrative village, and the full coverage of the police force and the area under its jurisdiction has been achieved...\" December 7 , In the \"One Village One Police\" office of the Public Security Bureau of Yichuan County, Shaanxi Province, the police pointed to the map on the wall and introduced the reporter to the reporter. Everyone has a \"responsibility field\". In order to practice the \"people-centered\" development concept, let the \"Fengqiao Experience\" blossom and bear fruit in Yichuan, solve the current situation of weak prevention, complicated public security, and insufficient police force in rural areas, and explore the grassroots An effective path for governance. In 2020, the Yichuan County Public Security Bureau decided to implement the \"one village, one police officer\" mechanism, allowing 124 police auxiliary police officers from the agency to go to 112 administrative villages and 4 communities in the county to cooperate with the local police station police. , prevention, publicity, service and other basic work at the grassroots level. According to Li Jianglong, member of the Party Committee and Director of the Political Work Office of the Yichuan County Public Security Bureau, in order to ensure the solid development of the work of \"one police officer in one village\", the bureau has set up a special working organization and formulated an implementation plan for \"one police officer in one village\". The main content is to interview people's feelings, solve people's worries, resolve conflicts, prevent risks, investigate problems, and deal with chaotic points, and create a safe demonstration village (community) with \"zero incidents, zero crimes, zero accidents, and zero turnover of contradictions\" as the work. The goal is to establish seven working mechanisms of color separation visits, key work goals, information registration, leadership package capture, clue forwarding, joint publicity, assessment, reward and punishment, so as to effectively deliver loving services to the masses, resolve conflicts and risks around the masses, and reduce risks to the masses. Peace and happiness will be guarded by the masses, and efforts will be made to achieve the goal of solid foundations, fewer accidents, and good public security. \"As long as there is time in the work of the agency, I will drive to the village by myself to understand the needs of the villagers and chat with the villagers about the current situation...\" On the day of the interview, the reporter happened to meet the command center of the Yichuan County Public Security Bureau Auxiliary police officer Yan Rong was about to go to Ganyigou Village, which she had captured. On the way to go together, Yan Rong introduced to the reporter every bit of the story since Baocun. \"This is a work record book, this is a mobile police service, a flashlight, a police-community contact card, a brochure on preventing telecommunication and network fraud...\" In the police work bag that Yan Rong brought, the reporter saw her every time she went to Murakami. A lot of work information with you. Open Yan Rong's \"One Village, One Police\" work record book, which records in detail the village's public security, resolution of conflicts and disputes, and entry into the village and households. \"The police often come, and 'one policeman in one village' gives everyone a sense of security. We applaud with both hands!\" The villager Chai Haijun repeatedly praised the work of \"one policeman in one village\" being carried out by the Yichuan County Public Security Bureau. \"Since Yan Rong has been stationed in the village, our contact has become much more convenient. We can call anytime if there is any problem. We have done a lot of work in anti-fraud publicity, business handling, and dispute mediation.\" Chai Haijun told reporters that for the villagers to come Said that Yan Rong is not only a good and responsible auxiliary police officer, but more like everyone's \"relatives\", because she always thinks about the villagers in her heart. Paying for the birthday of the elderly living alone, applying for subsidies and social assistance for the elderly in difficulties, helping the masses to do business... \"After all, one's power is limited, and I want to mobilize more power around me to help the more difficult people. Do practical things and good deeds for the masses.\" Yan Rong said. The number of police received dropped by 34%, the number of criminal cases dropped by 17%, the number of administrative cases dropped by 27%, and the number of disputes dropped by 41%.\u201d The most profound feeling about the long-term working mechanism of \u201cone village, one police officer\u201d It's the grassroots police station. Fu Guoping, the director of Yingwang Police Station, has been working in the local area for more than 10 years. The five policemen of the station are responsible for the tranquility of the more than 6,000 people in the area. In Yingwang Township, there are many floating population, the composition of personnel is more complex, and the management of social security is under great pressure. \"Since the implementation of this work, the most obvious thing is that the incidence rate has been effectively controlled. The number of public security cases in the jurisdiction is now 10 to 12 cases per year, which has greatly reduced the pressure on the grassroots police stations and effectively alleviated the lack of grassroots police forces. Fu Guoping said: Take Ruping Village as an example, as a large village of more than 1,000 people, it is inevitable that some security cases will occur. In the past, cases such as fighting and gambling occurred from time to time, but after the police stationed in the village, the Effective prevention and resolution, it is now a zero-incident village group, and the township is civilized and the neighborhood relationship is harmonious and orderly. Now in Yichuan, every administrative village has set up a police work station or a police work studio. While escorting the safety of the masses, it is also an \"information point\" for grasping social conditions and public opinion, a \"duty point\" for dealing with public security issues, and a The \"service point\" for the convenience of the people has effectively achieved \"no conflict, no accident, no lack of service\". It is understood that since the implementation of the long-term work of \"one village, one police officer\" by the Yichuan County Public Security Bureau, it has carried out the practical activities of \"I do practical things for the masses\". The group of children loves to help students, advocates social caring enterprises and caring people to donate 2,000 yuan each year to 4 college students and 15 primary and secondary school students, and jointly plans to make donations for 50 special families."}, {"date": "2021-12-23", "title": "\u4e1c\u839e1498\u4e07\u5927\u5956\u5f97\u4e3b\u83b7\u5956\u4e00\u5468\u540e\u5151\u5956", "text":

"The day after the Dongguan Welfare Lottery's third tens of millions in December, the winner of the first tens of millions of the month was long in coming to claim the prize. On December 5th, the 2021139th issue of \"Double Color Ball\" was drawn. In the current period, 14 first prizes were drawn nationwide, with a single bet bonus of 7,490,724 yuan. Liaobu lottery players in Dongguan won the two-color ball award with a total prize of more than 14.98 million yuan by virtue of a single-machine vote of 4 yuan, 1 note and 2 times. On the afternoon of December 13, the grand prize winner, Mr. Lai (pseudonym), accompanied by his children, went to the Dongguan Welfare Lottery Center to redeem the prize. At the scene, the staff asked why Mr. Lai did not come to accept the award until a week later. \"I almost missed the grand prize,\" Mr. Lai replied. It turned out that due to recent physical discomfort, Mr. Lai returned to his hometown to recuperate the day after he bought the lottery ticket, so he did not check the lottery numbers in time. Due to the long journey, he forgot the lottery ticket in his coat pocket. It was not until the afternoon of the fifth day after the draw that Mr. Lai accidentally dug out the lottery ticket in his pocket and remembered to check the winning numbers. If it weren't for this accidental move, he would probably have missed the big prize. After double-checking the numbers, Mr. Lai immediately called to inform his sons and daughters who were working in other places. In order to witness the moment of redemption, the sons and daughters came to Dongguan to accompany their father to redeem the prize. According to Mr. Lai, he is in his 50s and is a senior lottery player who has been buying lottery tickets since the 1990s. \"In the beginning, I saw other people buy it, and I bought it myself.\" Mr. Lai said that he can not only do public welfare, but also have the possibility of winning the big prize, so he bought it for more than 20 years. Around 2000, Mr. Lai started a small business and invested a lot in buying lottery tickets. He had to buy more than 100 yuan for each \"two-color ball\" lottery draw. However, after the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia, Mr. Lai's investment in each \"two-color ball\" has also dropped to less than ten yuan. To be able to win the grand prize this time is a relief for Mr. Lai. For the 14.98 million yuan welfare lottery bonus, he already has a preliminary plan. Mr. Lai plans to pay off the debt he owes first, and the rest will be used for the second venture. \"The lucky lottery gave me this luck, and I want to make good use of it,\" he said."}, {"date":

Guo'an coach Bilic said at yesterday's pre-match press conference that the team will show a good performance and reverse the unfavorable situation of the previous big loss. The lineup completes this stage of the league. A few days ago, the official of the Swiss Grasshopper Football Club announced the news of the joining of Guoan player Li Lei. This also means that after this season, Li Lei will leave Guoan to play in Europe. Regarding the question of whether Li Lei will continue to be used in the next few games, Bilic replied: \"Li Lei's contract with the club is about to expire. He wants to go to Europe to experience, which is also a good idea. I wish him in the future. Everything is going well. At present, his physical condition and competitive state are good, and I will still use him at any time.\" In fact, it is difficult for the Guoan team to compete for the top three points in the league, especially after the disastrous defeat in the last round, which has fallen behind the \"leaders\" \"Shandong team scored 15 points, and many fans expressed their hope that the team should use more young players. Bilic has a different view on this, he said: \"Yes, these young players have been training with us, but we are in the championship group, we still have to fight for the honor of the club and show respect for the league, We must try our best to ensure better results, because each ranking is different.

The \"data iron cage\" ensures efficient, fair, standardized, well-intentioned and civilized execution. According to He Dongning, deputy director of the Executive Bureau of the Supreme People's Court, the opinions are divided into 6 parts, with a total of 43 articles. It clearly proposes to deepen the separation of judicial power and executive power. Effectively bring into play the restrictive role of trial, bankruptcy, and state compensation procedures on enforcement powers, and avoid infringing on the rights and interests of parties by acting as a trial judge, illegal individual settlement, and failure to initiate state compensation procedures in a timely manner; The power of adjudication supervises and restricts the power of execution; improve the operation mechanism of the power of execution with intensive affairs and separation of complex and simple, realize the transformation from one person handling the case to the staged and intensive handling, and strengthen the supervision of passive execution and selective execution. , and effectively solve the stubborn problem of power rent-seeking. He Dongning said that the opinions put forward clear requirements on the management of execution funds, and fully implement the \"one case, one account\" management model. Once the execution case funds account is clearly accepted in the relevant legal documents, the execution personnel shall not require the person to be executed to enter the case funds into the account.

In the process of going global, Chinese enterprises actively fulfill their environmental responsibilities, adhere to the concept of green development, deeply cultivate green markets, and consciously protect and improve surrounding areas. Ecological environment and help local achieve sustainable development goals. Proliferation and release to protect endangered species Norberto Viana is a biological expert working at the Fish Farming Center of China Three Gorges (Brazil) Co., Ltd. One of the center's jobs is stocking and releasing, where farmed fry are released into natural waters. Vianna has been working here since 1987 and has seen the improvement of the local environment by the proliferative release. On the Parana Panema River, a tributary of the Paran\u00e1 River, there are 54 fish ponds built in the fish breeding center of the Salto Hydropower Station, with a water area of 20,000 square meters, and 7 kinds of local fish are currently cultivated. \"The proliferation and release sites are mainly in power station reservoirs and river tributaries. These places are conducive to the rapid growth of fish schools and are not easy to be preyed on. After the release of local fish species, they can adapt to the local watershed environment and form sustainable populations,\" said Vianna. In 2016, Three Gorges Brazil acquired the Grand Salto Hydropower Station to further strengthen the operation of the breeding center. Under the authorization and guidance of the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Resources, the center releases 1.5 million fry into the Parana Panema River and 2.1 million fry into the Paran\u00e1 River every year. \u201cOur actions have important implications for maintaining biodiversity and expanding fish stocks in the region, as well as economic and cultural value to communities along the river. At the Taquajusu Power Station Reservoir on the Paranapanema River, our augmentation The release operation has made a once endangered freshwater fish a fishable species again.\" Vianna said that in recent years, the center has cooperated with scientific research institutions such as universities to study methods to promote the expansion of fish populations. Local schools hold lectures and organize activities to allow students to participate in exile activities. In 2018, \"The Ecology and Fish Management Project of Gran Salto Hydropower Station\" won the Best Practice Award in the 16th Brazil Sustainable Development Best Practice Competition. \"Protecting the environment is one of our priorities, the water environment is critical for clean energy production and society as a whole, and we have driven some actions to protect biodiversity and sustainable development.\" Rogerio Marr, Environmental Manager, Three Gorges Brazil Kato said. For example, the invasive alien species golden mussel has a strong reproductive capacity, which not only threatens the environment, but also causes great damage to the water quality of the watershed and water conservancy and hydropower projects. Since 2017, Chinese companies have cooperated with a local biotechnology company to draw the genetic map of golden mussels, and try to make the next generation of genetically modified golden mussels and wild golden mussels no longer have the ability to reproduce, so as to control their numbers and protect water ecology. . The results of the project are expected to be available within a few years. Monitoring and reusing aquatic macrophytes is also important. Aquatic macrophytes are important to ecosystems, protecting river banks and providing food and shelter for aquatic life, but their rapid and excessive reproduction affects biodiversity and hinders human activities such as navigation, fishing and hydropower. Chinese enterprises cooperate with local scientific research institutions to develop aquatic plant monitoring systems and establish an aquatic plant information database to provide decision-making basis for aquatic environment governance. At the same time, aquatic macrophytes are also expected to be converted into biofuels. \"We are evaluating the application potential of different aquatic macrophytes to improve fuel quality and expand production scale,\" said Ricardo de Barros, environmental analyst at Three Gorges Brazil. \"In the future, our research results can be promoted in Brazil and abroad. Help solve the environmental problems caused by the overgrowth of aquatic macrophytes and turn them into energy.\" \"Charging\" for a sustainable future The Wiltshire town of Mendy, 140km west of London, UK, is undergoing a major power project. Make this town stand out. On June 30, China Huaneng Group's UK Mendi battery energy storage project was officially put into commercial operation, and it has been running smoothly for more than five months. This is currently the largest grid-side single battery energy storage power station in Europe, and the first large-scale battery energy storage project built by a Chinese power company in a developed country. The Mendi battery energy storage project has an installed capacity of 100 megawatts and is equipped with a battery capacity of 1 hour. Its performance indicators have reached the international leading level. \"I think this is a very exciting project to help reduce carbon emissions locally and promote renewable energy development and we welcome it,\" Wiltshire Council cabinet member Toby Sturgess said. The main equipment of this project is manufactured and integrated by Chinese enterprises, and the localization rate exceeds 70%. It mainly participates in services such as peak regulation and fast frequency response of the British power grid, creating conditions for the British power grid to absorb more renewable energy and helping the country achieve 2050 Annual zero carbon emission target. \"The Mendi project originated from a 'big blackout'.\" Guo Jingyu, chief representative of Huaneng Group in the UK, introduced that on August 9, 2019, a serious power outage occurred in the UK, exposing the lack of power grid flexibility facilities. In recent years, renewable energy has developed rapidly in the UK, and its share of power generation in 2019 exceeded that of fossil energy for the first time. However, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are intermittent and fluctuating, and the grid must have greater flexibility. Therefore, building a battery energy storage project that can quickly participate in peak and frequency regulation is one of the best options to improve the flexibility and security of the power grid. Chinese enterprises responded to this demand at the first time. The Mendi project took only one and a half years from the start of construction to the operation, during which time the adverse impact of the epidemic was overcome. \"During the construction and operation of the project, we always put the local ecological protection at the top of our work.\" Guo Jingyu said that before the project started, the Chinese side invited experts to conduct a detailed and comprehensive ecological assessment of the surrounding environment, and found a place about 400 meters north of the project site. There are two species of rare butterflies that inhabit the Swamp Leopard and the Red-backed Fluttershy. It has been assessed that the project will not adversely affect the two species of butterflies. However, experts also found that a large-crowned salamander lives in a pond only 56 meters away from the southern boundary of the project. In order to protect these \"indigenous people\", the project team installed a 1,200-meter-long 1,200-meter-long installation around the site before the start of construction. amphibian protection fence. In the future, a large-crowned salamander wintering nest made of native wood and stone will be built in the south of the site. Chinese companies have also explored new business models and signed the first power purchase and sale agreement for battery energy storage projects in the UK market with guaranteed bottom line with Shell European Energy. On October 10th, the Mendi project ran smoothly for 100 days, and the performance indicators of 40 sets of battery energy storage subsystems in the whole station reached the design expectations, becoming the largest service provider in the UK National Grid dynamic control and frequency regulation market. Providing dynamic control and frequency modulation services has extremely high requirements on the power response time of the units. At present, there are a total of 800 MW of battery energy storage power stations in the UK that can meet this requirement. In recent years, battery energy storage has become a key technology to promote renewable energy from alternative energy to main energy. Under the global carbon emission reduction trend, battery energy storage projects may usher in explosive growth in the next five years. The second phase of the Mendi project has recently started construction. After the project is put into operation, it will further enhance the capacity of the UK National Grid to accommodate renewable energy. Wu Qiaowen, the British trade envoy to China, said: \"The Mendi battery energy storage project will become the largest lithium battery energy storage system in the whole of Europe and an important part of the UK's renewable energy industry. We welcome more Chinese investment. Not only will it benefit the development of enterprises in the two countries, drive employment and economic growth, but also help to build a better and greener economy.\u201d Retain more natural wildness Go for a walk in the woods with fresh air in the morning, and go to a food center with a beautiful environment at noon Dining, swimming and fitness in spare time... In the near future, residents near the Singapore Sembawang Integrated Community Center will be able to welcome such a leisure life scene. The Sembawang Integrated Community Center project is located in the northern part of Singapore, built near the mountains, with a total construction area of 152,000 square meters. The original intention of its development is to build convenient facilities on the basis of the original natural environment, so that residents can enjoy nature while having leisure and entertainment. In 2018, China State Construction (Nanyang) Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"CSCEC Nanyang\") won the bid for the project. Since the project is located near a virgin forest, how to retain the large number of wild trees on the original site and integrate it into the planned community center has become a difficult problem. Wan Haitao, the project manager, said that during the construction preparation stage, CSCEC Nanyang carried out inventory, inspection, classification, and identification of the trees within the planning scope, and asked arborist experts to evaluate them. During the construction period, the plan was adjusted many times. Protect trees as much as possible. For example, a park area was originally designed with a walkway through the woods, but in the early stage of construction, the builders found that there were many trees that were not marked on the drawings. To this end, the Chinese company cooperated with the National Parks Board of Singapore to revise the design plan and adjust the location of the trail. In this way, not only the vegetation in the area is preserved, but people walking on this tree-lined trail can also enjoy more natural wildness. Another example is that the project was originally designed to have a drainage ditch, but there are 6 trees over 10 meters high in the construction area. In order not to cause damage to the roots of the trees, the Chinese company changed the location of the drainage ditch. \"In the spirit of respecting and protecting nature, more than 500 trees have been preserved throughout the project,\" Wan Haitao said. In recent years, Singapore has focused on tackling climate change, continuously improving the environmental sustainability standards of buildings, and has set the highest level of green building mark certification - the Green Mark Platinum Award. The Sembawang Integrated Community Center Project aims to obtain the Green Mark Platinum Award, and integrates the concept of green environmental protection into all aspects of project design and construction. The roof of the center is fully covered by soilless plants. In Singapore's hot climate all year round, this design not only looks green, but can also play a role in cooling, sound absorption and noise reduction; the rainwater drainage system in the garden area is used. Stones, gravel, plants and other natural materials collect rainwater and filter sediment sediment layer by layer, creating a natural river scene, which is both beautiful and can purify the water source; the project also uses a large number of prefabricated components, although the construction accuracy is raised. High requirements, but can minimize the construction waste generated during construction. Looking at the project design drawings, buildings with different shapes such as stadiums, gymnasiums, and food centers are hidden in the greenery. After completion, the Sembawang Comprehensive Community Center will also include clinics, elderly care centers, child health care centers, etc., covering the needs of residents of all ages in the community, and will bring great convenience to the lives of local people. In this regard, the nearby residents are looking forward to it. \"This is an ambitious project, and I hope it will become a meeting point that attracts the residents of Sembawang,\" said Xu Wenyuan, Singapore's former coordinating minister for infrastructure. From windmills to wind farms \"How are wind turbines built? \"Why is the electricity generated by wind turbines called green energy?\"... Not long ago, the French BFM TV broadcasted a prime-time program, which is the European Energy Company of China General Nuclear Power Group (hereinafter referred to as \"CGN European Energy\") in the southern city of France. At the cloud open event held by Asaq, the children who came to visit showed great interest in the working principle of wind turbines. Led by well-known French host Charlotte Butrup, 250 local primary school students, farmers and Mayor Miria Vigreux experienced the changes that wind can bring to this small town. In the eyes of local residents, the Asaq wind farm has brought green energy, can supply electricity to about 6,500 homes, and has also promoted the sustainable development of the community. In Asaq, there is a hiking path called \"From Wind Farm to Windmill Mill\", which is 6 kilometers long and is the first hiking route through the small town. \"This road travels through time and space, connecting the ancient windmills and modern wind farms on the river bank, bringing new vitality to the town.\" Vigreu said that Chinese enterprises participated in the development of the hiking route and sponsored the explanation. Fan sign. At present, the Asaq Wind Farm has been included in the local industrial tourism promotion project by the local tourism bureau. \"Assac City Government and Chinese companies also carry out public welfare visits with the theme of exploring wind farms. As an industrial tourism project, Assac Wind Farm will definitely attract more people to visit and understand.\" Vigreu said. Not only in Assac, from the Charmont wind farm, 200 kilometers east of Paris, to the pilot demonstration project of floating offshore wind power on the island of Groy in the Brittany region, since its establishment in Paris in 2014, CGNPC has With the development of wind energy as its core business, Oneng has gradually developed into one of the major clean energy operators in France, creating jobs for the local society and promoting Sino-French clean energy cooperation. Chinese energy companies gradually open up the market and establish a good reputation in the local area. It is understood that these new energy projects all follow environmental protection standards for land planning and animal and plant protection measures. In the matrix design of wind farms, it is preferable to reduce the installed capacity rather than destroy the species protection area. Chris Francois, an environmental expert at CGN European Energy, said that the company will conduct continuous monitoring of each power station, and do a good job in animal protection by regularly shutting down and installing bird reminders. \"We installed monitoring and sound warning equipment, and based on the real-time monitoring of bird species, distances, and flight trajectories, we judged the danger of collision and activated the warning equipment to avoid collisions,\" Francois said. In addition, these wind power projects also focus on reducing noise and visual pollution, and protecting biodiversity. In the global remote monitoring and data analysis center of CGNPC European Energy located in the La Defense business district of Paris, on two huge LCD screens, real-time data such as temperature, humidity, wind power, and power generation of 16 projects in 7 European countries are displayed. Jumping nonstop. Up to now, CGN European Energy has a total installed capacity of 2.4 GW. In 2020, the on-grid electricity of new energy will exceed 5 billion kWh, which can supply electricity to 2 million European households, and the carbon emission reduction is equivalent to planting more than 13,000 hectares of trees. Since the official launch of the China-EU Energy Cooperation Platform project in 2019, China and the EU have achieved more substantial results in cooperation in the industrialization of clean energy technologies, market access, grid connection, and the use of renewable energy. Chinese energy companies have cooperated with many The old European energy companies have carried out more and more cooperation.

River is a testimony to the growth of the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone. With the development of the city, the scenery on both sides of the Qianshan River has developed from reeds and farmland into a prosperous business district. With the development of the city, the pollution has increased, and the color of the river has also changed. In recent years, the Zhuhai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have attached great importance to the management of Qianshan River, and the management of Qianshan River has entered the fast lane. Zhuhai is one of the central cities in the Pearl River Delta and an important node city in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The environmental governance of the \"Mother River\" is related to Zhuhai's \"face\" and \"lizi\". In order to completely rectify the water environment of the Qianshan River Basin, at the end of 2019, Zhuhai City and Xiangzhou District introduced China Power Construction Ecological Environment Group to promote the comprehensive improvement of the Qianshan River Basin in Zhuhai. From January to September this year, the average water quality of the Shijiaozui National Examination Section of the Qianshan River reached the Class III standard for surface water, and the black and odorous water bodies in 5 cities in the basin have all passed the \u201clong-term and long-term clearing\u201d assessment and audit by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development by the end of 2020. While laying a solid ecological foundation for the development of Zhuhai, it also provides a replicable Zhuhai model for water environment governance in cities of the same scale in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Written by: Wang Shaojiang shoulders the heavy responsibility of \"landing\" the Qianshan River Basin in Zhuhai with the EPC model, which belongs to the Pearl River Delta river network. Macau faces each other. As the only freshwater river in the main urban area of Zhuhai, Qianshan River in history was once an important source of drinking water, nurturing the people of Zhuhai. However, with the rapid economic and social development, the urban population continues to grow, the construction of urban rain and sewage infrastructure has not been followed up, the urban municipal pipeline network is insufficiently covered, the existing pipeline network has many defects, the mixed flow of rain and sewage in the pipeline network of residential areas is serious, and a large number of living Sewage has been mixed into Qianshan River, and agricultural and industrial pollution has not been completely treated. The water quality of Qianshan River Basin (Zhuhai Section) has continued to deteriorate. The originally clear river has turned into V-type water, and some tributaries have become black and odorous water bodies. In 2015, the State Council promulgated and implemented the \"Water Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan\" (\"Ten Water Regulations\"), which clearly stated that by the end of 2020, black and odorous water bodies in built-up areas of cities above the prefecture level will be controlled within 10%; The black and odorous water bodies were generally eliminated. The comprehensive improvement of the water environment in the Qianshan River Basin is imminent. In 2019, the Zhuhai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government formulated the \"Overall Implementation Plan for the Comprehensive Treatment of Water Environment in Qianshan River Basin\", which divided the comprehensive treatment of Qianshan River water environment into three years for implementation. Strive to basically achieve \"the original source, clear the source, divert rain and sewage\" within three years, and achieve the goal of \"smooth river, clear water, green shore and beautiful scenery\" in the long run. In terms of specific implementation, China Power Construction Ecological Environment Group adopts the EPC model to manage Qianshan River. Previously, China Power Construction Eco-Environmental Group has adopted this model to successfully manage a number of river environmental governance projects, the most typical of which is the Shenzhen Maozhou River Basin Water Environment Governance Project. The Maozhou River with a total length of 41.6 kilometers is the boundary river between Shenzhen and Dongguan. At its peak, there were more than 40,000 industrial enterprises in the Maozhou River Basin. Before the treatment, the Maozhou River was called the most polluted river in the Pearl River Delta. The river water continued to blacken and stink, like ink. After the continuous efforts of China Power Construction Ecological Environment Group, the water quality of Maozhou River has been continuously improved, and finally the ecological butterfly change has been realized from \"cross-flow of black water\" to \"flying of gulls and herons\". \"As the first large-scale water environment treatment project in China with a value of over 10 billion yuan, the successful case of water environment treatment in the Maozhou River Basin has carried out a positive and beneficial exploration for the national ecological environment management, and has achieved sustainable development for the industry and enterprises, transformation and upgrading, and quality improvement. The efficiency increase has laid a solid foundation.\" Zhang Jing, general manager of the Bay Area Regional Headquarters of China Power Construction Eco-Environment Group and general contracting department of the Qianshanhe Project, introduced that it is with these \"merit medals\" that China Power Construction Eco-Environment Group stands out. It has shouldered the important task of comprehensive renovation of the former mountains and rivers. Digging the roots and tracing the source of more than 3,700 drainage outlets The Qianshan River Basin has a long history of environmental problems, and it is a long way to go to restore the Qianshan River to be \"long-term and clean\". The key is to identify the root cause of the disease and prescribe the right medicine. The Qianshan River Basin Comprehensive Renovation Project in Xiangzhou District, Zhuhai City was signed on December 19, 2019, and the general contracting department of the project was established simultaneously. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on January 2, 2020, and the project officially started. After the start of construction, the general contracting department will conduct a comprehensive investigation, traceability, repair and improvement of the main sewage pipe network system in the river canals, pipe networks and discharge outlets within the basin; The sewage system is checked to realize the diversion of rain and sewage in the corresponding drainage unit; the sewage collection rate in the area is improved, and the total amount of pollutants entering the river is greatly reduced. However, the total area of the Qianshan River Basin for comprehensive renovation is about 114.35 square kilometers. There are many river networks in the basin, which are criss-crossed and interconnected. There are 44 canals, 544 communities, 527 commercial enterprises, and 166 government agencies and institutions. , It is not easy to sort out each community from house to house. Zhang Jing said, \u201cCompared with the deterioration of water quality caused by industrial pollution in the Maozhou River, the core of water pollution control in Qianshan River lies in the comprehensive rectification of rain and sewage diversion in the municipal sewage pipe network. Qianshan River Basin is mostly an old urban area and an old urban area. In villages and suburban areas, the pipeline network in the area is aging, wrongly connected and missed, so we must first find out the base of the underground pipeline network, and find the missing sections, damaged points, and mixed connections of these pipeline networks.\" At the beginning of 2020, in order to quickly To find out the pipe network of the main pipe, branch pipes, outfalls along the river and each drainage unit within 114.35 square kilometers of the Qianshan River Basin, China Power Construction Eco-Environment Group has organized a professional inspection team of more than 500 people, using pipe network inspection robots, 3D Laser imagers, CCTV, QV and other advanced equipment are used to find out the situation of the pipeline network, and complete the monitoring of 5 black and odorous water bodies such as Cuiping, Beishan, Beizao, Nanpingdong, Yinlin flood discharge channel and the main channel of Qianshan River. A total of more than 3,700 drainage outlets on both sides of the strait were traced to the source, and then the river channel, main pipe, branch pipe and drainage unit pipe network were drawn into a network map, which provided reliable conditions for the final improvement of the rainwater and sewage pipe network. Under the influence of the epidemic, many external constraints and resource constraints, the General Contracting Department has successively set off key goals such as \"January 20\", \"April 15\", \"10.30\" and \"Emergency Attack on Cuiping Canal\". On October 30, 2020, the main construction of the Qianshan River project was completed ahead of schedule, and the water quality of the national examination section stably reached the Class IV water standard. During the implementation of the project, China Power Construction Eco-Environmental Group invested more than 3,500 people on average per month, more than 5,000 people during peak periods, and more than 1,700 sets of equipment. The construction of the Zhuhai pipeline network reached a new record of 3.75 kilometers in a single day. About 400 communities and 100 government agencies and institutions have completed the original Qingyuan construction. The original Qingyuan District pipeline network has accumulated more than 550 kilometers and the municipal pipeline network construction has accumulated to 60 kilometers. The EPC project of comprehensive improvement of the Qianshan River Basin has promoted the whole basin water body improvement, rain and sewage diversion, pipeline network construction and maintenance, and original source clearing transformation. Newborn, the stench that used to be emitted is now almost imperceptible, and the river water is clearer. Seeing that the water in Qianshan River is getting better day by day, Mr. Kang, who lives nearby, gives a thumbs up, \"Now Qianshan River is getting more and more lively, and every day after dinner, I have to go for a walk by the river with my family.\" The data shows that Qianshan River Stone In 2020, the monthly average water quality of the Jiaozui National Examination Section reached the surface class IV water standard, and the average value of major water quality indicators such as ammonia nitrogen reached the surface class III water standard. As a result, Zhuhai also entered the national national examination section from January to June that year. The water environment quality has improved. Top 30 cities. The national examination section management results were praised in writing by the Guangdong Department of Ecology and Environment. On the basis of high-quality performance of the contract, Qianshanhe General Contracting Department of China Power Construction Eco-Environment Group actively fulfilled the responsibility of a central enterprise, and invested in emergency rescue forces to fully support the construction of the emergency project of Cuiping flood discharge canal; Launched the emergency rescue plan for the project, dispatched personnel and equipment to assist the local government in carrying out post-disaster rescue work; during the repeated epidemic in 2021, the company immediately assisted the epidemic prevention and control work in Gongbei Street, Xiangzhou District, and won high praise from the local government and the public. It has created a good image of POWERCHINA's central enterprise that dares to fight hard and can win battles. Through the overall planning and systematic management of the water environment in the Qianshan River Basin, China Power Construction Ecological Environment Group has made the \"mother river\" sparkling with blue waves and groups of fish and shrimps in front of the public. On this basis, the second phase of the comprehensive improvement of the water environment in the Qianshan River Basin has entered the design stage and is scheduled to start within this year. The second phase of the Qianshan River project will focus on improving water quality, focusing on controlling non-point source pollution, reducing the water level in main pipes, and increasing the concentration of sewage treatment plants. Three major types of projects, including pollution collection and source control projects, living water quality preservation projects, and smart water projects, will build Qianshan River into a \"beautiful river\" integrating ecological corridors, flood channels, leisure green roads, cultural post roads, and waterfront economic belts.

Supervision and Administration Commission clarifies that the quality of state-controlled listed companies will be improved", "en_text": "Du Yumeng State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission held a meeting of the heads of central enterprises in Beijing, disclosing the economic operation of central enterprises in the first 11 months, and further clarified the key tasks such as the production, operation, reform and development of central enterprises in 2022, such as the continuous improvement of state-owned listed companies. quality, deepening the integration of cross-industry, cross-field and cross-enterprise specialization, etc. Continuing to improve the quality of state-controlled listed companies Data from the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission shows that this year, the growth of central SOEs has reached the best level in history, and new steps have been taken in high-quality development. In the first 11 months, the total profit of central enterprises reached 2.3 trillion yuan, and the net profit was 1.75 trillion yuan. The operating income profit margin reached 7.1%, an increase of 1.1 percentage points year-on-year; the R&D investment intensity was 2.3%, an increase of 0.1 percentage points year-on-year, and it is expected to reach 2.6% for the whole year. Two other figures are equally interesting. Data show that from January to November, central enterprises injected 122.15 billion yuan of high-quality assets into listed companies, and used the platform of listed companies to implement equity financing of 198.69 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 17.4% and 64.7% respectively. In this meeting, it was mentioned in the eight key tasks of the production, operation and reform and development of central enterprises next year that central enterprises should optimize their business strategies, vigorously reduce costs and expenses, continue to promote the management and control of \"two funds\", and ensure a reasonable and sufficient cash flow for operating activities. , continue to improve the quality of state-controlled listed companies. Zhang Lichao, a senior researcher at Guosen Securities, said that high-quality economic development requires high-quality listed companies, and promoting the sustainable, stable and healthy development of the capital market also requires improving the quality of listed companies from the source. The continuous improvement of the quality of state-controlled listed companies is embodied in: focusing on improving the quality of operations represented by business performance, solvency, and asset allocation; the quality of governance represented by information disclosure, market value management, investor relations management, etc.; and research and development funds. Innovation quality represented by human capital investment. In fact, the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises and the improvement of the quality of listed companies are mutually causal and mutually reinforcing. According to statistics from Flush iFinD, as of December 19, 86 A-share listed companies have taken the lead in disclosing their 2021 annual performance forecasts. There are a total of 65 listed companies whose performance forecasts are slightly increased, continued profit, and pre-increased, of which 7 are state-controlled listed companies (including central state-owned enterprises, provincial state-owned assets, and prefecture-level state-owned assets). It is worth mentioning that, in order to further guide the central enterprises to better play the role of the stabilizer and ballast of the national economy, the meeting emphasized that the \"two interests and four rates\" for the assessment of central enterprises next year should strive to achieve \"two increases, one control and three\". improve\". \"Two increases\" means that the growth rate of total profit and net profit is higher than that of the national economy, \"one control\" means to control the asset-liability ratio, and \"three increases\" means that the profit margin of operating income, the labor productivity of all employees, and the investment in research and development funds are further increased . Deepening cross-industry, cross-field and cross-enterprise specialization integration \"effectively enhancing the resilience and competitiveness of the industrial chain and supply chain, and accelerating the construction of a modern industrial system\" has also become the focus of the SASAC's deployment of 2022 tasks. The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to actively create a \"chain length\" of the modern industrial chain, promote the integration, innovation and coordinated development of upstream, midstream and downstream, large and medium-sized enterprises, cultivate a group of state-level advanced manufacturing clusters, systematically promote digital transformation, and create a group of leading technology companies, Specializing in special new enterprises and single champion enterprises. In 2022, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission will implement the \"chain length\" action plan for the modern industrial chain. That is, while accelerating the implementation of the first batch of \"chain-length\" enterprise plans, the selection of the second batch of key industrial chain \"chain-length\" enterprises will be launched. At the same time, focus on high-end equipment, new-generation information technology, new materials and other fields to cultivate a number of national-level advanced manufacturing clusters. Liu Xingguo, a researcher at the Research Department of the China Enterprise Confederation, said that only by further promoting central enterprises to increase investment in technology research and development, speed up the pace of breakthroughs in key technologies, build a competitive advantage in the global industrial chain with technological advantages, and enhance their influence on the global industrial chain and control, can better promote and protect my country's industrial security. Obviously, the \"chain length system\" is a suitable starting point. On the one hand, it helps to encourage \"chain length\" enterprises to continuously improve their technical level and development quality, and continue to be better, stronger and bigger, so as to maintain and strengthen the status of \"chain length\". On the other hand, it will also help to promote \"chain-length\" enterprises to consciously drive the integrated development of the entire industrial chain, enhance the vitality of the industrial chain as a whole, and thus provide a strong guarantee for economic security. As an important part of the three-year reform of state-owned enterprises, \"optimizing the layout of state-owned capital\" will still be the focus of the work of state-owned and central enterprises next year. The optimization and adjustment of the layout of state-owned assets is obviously inseparable from the reorganization and integration of central enterprises. In this regard, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission has made it clear that in 2022, it will deepen the professional integration of cross-industry, cross-field and cross-enterprise, and strengthen the construction of collaborative development platforms such as marine equipment, new energy vehicles, industrial Internet, logistics big data, and air cargo.

Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation", "en_text": "Achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation embodies the long-cherished wish of several generations of Chinese people, reflects the overall interests of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, and is the common aspiration of every son and daughter of the Chinese nation. Since its establishment, the Communist Party of China has always regarded seeking happiness for the Chinese people and seeking rejuvenation for the Chinese nation as its original mission. The \"Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the major achievements and historical experience of the party's century-old struggle\" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of The right way to revival. 'This road has gone through a century of wind and rain, and it has become brighter and wider, and it has reached the glorious shore of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the theme of the party's century-long struggle. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: \"In the past 100 years, all the struggles, sacrifices, and creations that the Communist Party of China has united and led the Chinese people to make can be summed up in one theme: realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. \"The Chinese nation is a great nation in the world, with a long history of civilization spanning more than 5,000 years, and has made indelible contributions to the progress of human civilization. After the Opium War in 1840, China gradually became a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. The country was humiliated, the people suffered, and the civilization was dusted. The Chinese nation suffered an unprecedented catastrophe. In order to save the nation from peril, the Chinese people rose up to resist, people with lofty ideals ran and shouted, and various national salvation plans were introduced one after another, but they all ended in failure. Among various political forces, only the Communist Party of China shoulders the historical mission of realizing the national salvation and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. As a Marxist political party, the Communist Party of China has got rid of the limitation of all political forces in the past to pursue its own special interests, and takes national rejuvenation as its own responsibility. The ability of the forest of nations in the world lights up the beacon of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Over the past 100 years, the Communist Party of China has united and led the Chinese people, created the great achievements of the new democratic revolution, created the fundamental social conditions for the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation; The revival has laid the fundamental political premise and institutional foundation; it has created the great achievements of reform and opening up and socialist modernization, and provided a system guarantee full of new vitality and material conditions for rapid development for the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation; created a new era of China The great achievements of socialism with characteristics have provided a more complete institutional guarantee, a more solid material foundation, and a more active spiritual force for the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Hundred years of struggle, vicissitudes of life. China has gone from being fragmented and scattered to a high degree of unity and national unity, from poverty and weakness, poor and poor, to a well-off, prosperous and strong, from passive beatings and bullying to independence and self-confidence, it took only a few decades to complete the developed countries. Hundreds of years of industrialization have created two miracles of rapid economic development and long-term social stability. Today, the Chinese nation is showing a thriving atmosphere to the world, standing majestically in the east of the world. The realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process. On November 29, 2012, General Secretary Xi Jinping, when visiting the exhibition \"Road to Rejuvenation\", proposed that \"to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese nation in modern times.\" Important conclusions make the \"Chinese Dream\" a powerful spiritual force that inspires Chinese people to move forward bravely. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping, with a broad historical vision, profound strategic thinking, and firm people's feelings, has coordinated the overall strategic situation of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the world's great changes unseen in a century, and profoundly expounded on the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The connotation, meaning, path and strategy, creatively incorporate the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation into the practice of scientific socialism and the journey of communism, guide the direction, reveal the laws, draw a blueprint, clarify the tasks, unite and lead the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country to solve many problems. The long-term unsolved problems that we wanted to solve but failed to solve have accomplished many major things that we wanted to do but failed to accomplish in the past, pushing the party and the country to achieve historic achievements and bring about historic changes. Today, we are closer, more confident and capable of realizing the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than at any time in history. Provide a more complete system guarantee. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: \"Since the reform and opening up, we have summed up historical experience and continued arduous exploration. Finally, we have found the right path to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and achieved remarkable results. This path is socialism with Chinese characteristics.\" Socialism is the dialectical unity of the theoretical logic of scientific socialism and the historical logic of Chinese social development. It is rooted in the land of China, reflects the will of the Chinese people, and adapts to the development and progress requirements of China and the times. It is the only way to accelerate socialist modernization and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. . Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put system construction in a more prominent position, emphasizing \"to build a system that is complete, scientific and standardized, and operates effectively, so that all aspects of the system will be more mature and finalized.\" The Third Plenary of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China identified \"improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and advancing the modernization of the country's governance system and governance capacity\" as the general goal of comprehensively deepening the reform. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made clear arrangements for comprehensively governing the country according to law. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China comprehensively summarized the historical achievements in the construction of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and systematically depicted the system map of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Over the past 9 years, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, China Land has embarked on a great transformation with great momentum and momentum. Taking system construction as the main line, various aspects have successively issued more than 2,000 reform plans, making comprehensive efforts, making breakthroughs in multiple points, and advancing in depth. Many areas have achieved historic changes, systematic reshaping, and overall reconstruction. Adhere to the comprehensive and strict governance of the party, focus on the construction of style with the vigor of stepping on the stone and grasping the traces of the iron, punishing corruption with a zero-tolerance attitude, revolutionizing the party and reshaping the army. The fundamental systems that underpin the socialist system with Chinese characteristics have been continuously strengthened, the basic systems have been improved, and important systems have been continuously innovated. Lay a more solid material foundation. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: \"The realization of the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is to realize the prosperity of the country, the rejuvenation of the nation, and the happiness of the people.\" The CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core is far-sighted and has a great plan, focusing on the transformation of the main contradictions in our society, insisting on putting the people at the center, taking the people's yearning for a better life as the goal of struggle, accurately grasping the new stage of development, and implementing it in a complete, accurate and comprehensive manner. New development concepts, speed up the construction of a new development pattern, deepen the supply-side structural reform, firmly implement major strategies such as rejuvenating the country through science and education, innovation-driven development, and regional coordinated development, and strive to prevent and resolve major risks, targeted poverty alleviation, and pollution prevention and control, and unite and lead the battle. The whole party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country have forged ahead, pioneered and innovated, and pushed China's economy into a high-quality development track. Through the continuous struggle of the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups, we have achieved the first centenary goal, built a moderately prosperous society in all aspects of China, solved the problem of absolute poverty historically, and wrote a great miracle in the history of human development. The total economic volume has achieved a new leap, and the gross domestic product has exceeded 100 trillion yuan; the development mode has changed, and \"Made in China\" has turned to \"Created in China\"; people's lives have been significantly improved, and the world's largest social safety net has been woven; the ecological environment has improved significantly. The beautiful Chinese face with blue sky, green water and clear water is beginning to show; the people's army is quenched into steel, and it is forging ahead towards a world-class army. These transformative practices, breakthrough progress, and landmark achievements are milestones in the party's century-long struggle, and have laid a stronger material foundation for the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We take advantage of the momentum to start a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way, laying a solid foundation for China's development, breaking through the key points, and creating a bright future for national rejuvenation. Stimulate a more active spiritual force. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: \"The rejuvenation of a nation requires strong material strength as well as strong spiritual strength.\" Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese Communists, mainly represented by Comrade Xi Jinping, have adhered to the Marxist standpoint and viewpoint. , methods to observe the times, grasp the times, lead the times, and created Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, which is contemporary Chinese Marxism and Marxism in the 21st century, providing us with a powerful ideological weapon to understand and transform the world, allowing us to The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has gained unprecedented historical and spiritual initiatives.

Since then, her parents and family have embarked on a 49-year search for relatives. Knowing that she was adopted, Xu Xiuli also began to look for relatives. After the \"Reunion Action\" was launched this year, Xu Xiuli and her biological parents sought help from the public security organs at almost the same time. Recently, with the help of the police in Shandong and Jiangsu, Xu Xiuli met her relatives who had been separated for 49 years. On November 25, accompanied by the police from the Economic Development Division of the Weifang Public Security Bureau, Xu Xiuli got on the train and rushed to Changshu, Jiangsu to meet her family. \"Daughter, I've been looking for you for 49 years, and I finally found you!\" At the Dayi Police Station of the Public Security Bureau of Changshu City, Jiangsu Province, Xu Xiuli hugged her biological parents tightly. 49 years ago, near the open-air plaza in Lianyungang, Jiangsu, Xu Xiuli's parents temporarily put their daughter under the care of others because they had to deal with it, but when they returned, the daughter disappeared. To this end, Xu Xiuli's parents traveled all over Jiangsu and searched for 49 years. After Xu Xiuli was adopted by her adoptive parents from somewhere in Zibo, she regarded her as her own. When her adoptive father passed away, Xu Xiuli inadvertently learned that she was not her own biological daughter, and she had the idea of looking for her relatives from then on. On August 15 this year, Xu Xiuli learned that Weifang Public Security had helped local families reunite by collecting blood samples for free, so she provided her own blood samples to the Economic Development Zone Bureau with the attitude of giving it a try. As if they had a heart-to-heart, at the end of September this year, Xu Xiuli's biological parents also provided their own blood samples with the attitude of giving it a try. In early November this year, Xu Xiuli successfully compared with her parents. Knowing that the second sister had eaten Weifang's meat fire and was obsessed with it, Xu Xiuli made more than ten kilograms of meat fire at home, and brought other Weifang specialties to recognize her relatives. \"We are also very happy to see her flying over to hug her relatives, and the happy laughter they made when they shared the meat,\" said a policeman from the Economic Development Zone of the Weifang Public Security Bureau."}, {"date": "2021-12-20", "title":

fission development and realizing the blue rise is the goal that Lufeng people set for themselves, and it also shows Lufeng's ambition and determination to catch up. In recent years, Lufeng has improved the balance and coordination of development in an all-round way by further improving the urban-rural integrated development mechanism, coordinating the promotion of rural revitalization, town and street revitalization, and urban revitalization. Today, a new picture of \"three beauties advancing together\" of urban beauty, township beauty and rural beauty is slowly unfolding, and the beautiful new Lufeng, which is suitable for living, working and traveling, is displayed. Lufeng is striving to walk out step by step with steady steps. A new way for the fission of urban and rural appearances. \u25cfWritten by: Peng Jun, Chen Xinxin, closely following the people's livelihood, and polishing the livable background. During this year's National Day, when everyone was immersed in the festive atmosphere, Shanwei's aunt Huang and her son had an \"uncomfortable\" scene. The old man insisted on moving back to Lu Feng's old house, insisting that \"it would be more comfortable to go back and live there\", which made his son who specially took her to the new house for retirement a little puzzled. The community where Aunt Huang lives is Yuyin Community, Donghai Town, built in the 1980s. From the chat with the old sister, the old man learned that Lu Feng has made great efforts to create a civilized city and upgraded the old community: the road that used to be bumpy and bumpy has become flat and spacious, all the wires like spider webs have gone into the ground, and the small leisure square has been renovated as new. Some aging-friendly facilities have also been added... The renovated Yuyin Community has a new look, which is also the main reason for attracting the elderly to come back. Since the beginning of this year, Lufeng City has carried out the practice activity of \"I do practical things for the masses\" in combination with the study and education of the party's history. Taking the action of creating a civilized city as the starting point, the city continues to comprehensively carry out the joint creation of civilization at the city, town and village levels, and focuses on the improvement of urban and rural environmental sanitation in various places, setting off a \"sanitation revolution\". In cities and towns, promote the renovation of old residential areas, dispose of domestic waste, and renovate the appearance of streets; in villages and towns, with the overall goal of rural revitalization, improve the living environment in rural areas, build beautiful villages, and carry out the work of \"three cleanups, three demolitions and three renovations\". In addition to the brand-new environmental changes and the new style of civilization deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, what the residents praised is the improvement and improvement in all aspects from the outside to the inside. Lufeng focuses on safe society, urban construction, people's livelihood services, road network facilities, education and medical care, and promotes livable construction in all fields. Lu Feng spared no effort to promote the people's livelihood goals of \"good education for the young, excellent education for learning, great rewards for labor, good doctors for the sick, good care for the elderly, livable living, and public support for the weak\", and achieved remarkable results. At present, the Political and Legal Committee of the Provincial Party Committee has officially lifted the rectification of key areas of social security in Lufeng, the city's social security has achieved a fundamental improvement, and the public security situation has been stable and improving; km, the transportation network is more three-dimensional and fast; the sewage treatment, natural gas pipelines, etc. have been optimized, and the municipal infrastructure has been optimized and upgraded; the newly built Longshan campus has been put into use, and the construction projects of Lufeng City, Jiaxiu Vocational School and Xin\u2019an Vocational School are progressing smoothly. It fills the gap of secondary vocational education in Jieshi and \"three top\" areas. Safety governance builds the foundation of livability, spiritual civilization promotes harmony and happiness, and medical education increases people's well-being. Under the light of the \"Nominated City of Guangdong Province's County-level Civilized City\" lighthouse, today's Lufeng, the common people travel more smoothly, live more warmly, security is more assured, life is more comfortable, the people's sense of happiness and security are unprecedented improvement. Thinking about the business economy is booming. At the moment, Lufeng is in a critical period of realizing the rise of the blue card and the blue. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to create a better business environment and attract more companies and projects to land here. . A good business environment is productivity, and Lu Feng knows this. In recent years, Lufeng has focused on the port industry, new energy, electronic information and other industries, and promoted the \"3+2\" industrial system to improve both quality and quality; focusing on \"eight facilitations\" and \"six general services\", it has fully launched the \"second shop\" We will continue to optimize the business environment, vigorously develop the real economy, and create a hot spot for innovation and entrepreneurship, so as to help achieve the rise of the blue card and the rise of the blue. Entering the Lufeng government service hall, it is spacious and bright, with 80 windows covering public security, taxation, social security, medical insurance and other fields. All government service matters in Lufeng city are stationed in the service hall. It took the lead in realizing the \"should enter must enter\" in Shanwei City, and launched a batch of online and offline integrated acceptance and 24-hour self-service efficient, convenient and distinctive government service projects. Xiao Chen, a citizen who came to work, became a private business owner in just one morning. \"I really didn't expect it to be so fast. I thought I would have to make at least three or four trips and wait for ten days and a half months.\" Holding the food business certificate in his hand, he was a little overwhelmed with excitement. Becoming a business owner in half a day and doing everything in one trip is nothing new in Lufeng. As Xiao Chen commented, \"As long as you come here, there is nothing that can't be done. There is always a window for you.\" In recent years, Lu Feng has deepened the reform of \"decentralization, management and services\". The six general procedures of land, one network, one certificate and one code are the starting points to create the \"four most\" government service environment with the least approval, the best process, the highest efficiency and the best service. For the high-frequency service matters that are closely related to the work and life of enterprises and citizens, the \"six general procedures\" are promoted, and the \"second batch\" audit is launched to achieve \"one door to do everything\", so that the masses can save time, effort, and more. Peace of mind. For key projects and enterprises, Lufeng City plays a good role as the \"Second Shopkeeper\" and takes the initiative to deliver services to the door. On-site coordination, responding to demands, and seamless connection. \"The work efficiency is high, the service is considerate, and the policy is more guaranteed. We are also willing to stay here and fight together with this city.\" People who have experienced door-to-door service said. A good business environment brings high-quality development. It seems like a small measure, but it actually affects the hearts of thousands of market players. Today, more and more companies are settling here. Jieshi Lingang Industrial Park, major projects of offshore engineering base, and Xingdu Economic Development Zone have started construction in Lufeng one after another. Eight key enterprises including CGN, Mingyang Wisdom, Zhongtian Technology, and Tianneng Heavy Industry have settled in Lufeng. Lufeng has become one of the most prosperous, The hottest place for innovation and entrepreneurship.

insurance drug list", "en_text": "According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 18th, relevant departments are taking action to solve the problem of drug use for patients with rare diseases. The reporter learned from the 2021 China Rare Disease Conference held in Beijing on the 18th that as of now, more than 60 rare disease drugs have been approved for marketing in China, of which more than 40 have been included in the National Medical Insurance Drug List, involving 25 diseases. Since its establishment in 2018, the National Medical Security Administration has dynamically adjusted the list of medical insurance drugs once a year, including drugs for rare diseases. At the same time, through the negotiation of access to rare disease drugs, the price of rare disease drugs has been greatly reduced. Li Tao, deputy director of the National Medical Security Administration, introduced at the meeting that in 2021, a total of 7 rare disease drugs have been successfully negotiated, with an average price drop of 65%. According to estimates by relevant institutions, there are about 20 million patients with various types of rare diseases in my country, with more than 200,000 new patients every year. In the face of an increasingly large group of rare disease patients, the pace of drug protection must be accelerated. In recent years, my country has implemented priority review and approval for rare disease treatment drugs. The State Drug Administration will include innovative drugs and improved new drugs for the prevention and treatment of rare diseases with obvious clinical value into the priority review and approval process. Chen Shifei, deputy director of the State Drug Administration, introduced that the State Drug Administration and the National Health Commission jointly issued an announcement on matters related to the review and approval of overseas new drugs that are urgently needed for clinical use. Among the 81 drugs selected and released in the three batches, more than half of the rare disease treatment drugs. At present, 26 rare disease drugs have been approved for marketing through the special channel for overseas new drugs urgently needed in clinical practice. \"Among all drug marketing applications, the time limit for the review and approval of rare disease drugs is the shortest.\" Chen Shifei said that in 2020, the newly revised drug registration management measures clarified that innovative drugs and improved new drugs for the prevention and treatment of rare diseases with obvious clinical value will be included. The priority review and approval process is to complete the review within 70 days for the rare disease drugs that have been marketed overseas and have not been marketed in China. According to reports, in 2021, the State Food and Drug Administration will newly approve 10 rare disease drugs, including risprom oral solution powder, for the treatment of rare diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy."}, {"date": "2021-12-19", "title": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u592a\u5e73\u4fdd\u9669\u96c6\u56e22021\u5e74\u79cb\u5b63\u6821\u56ed\u62db\u8058\u62df\u5f55\u7528\u9ad8\u6821\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u60c5\u51b5\u516c\u793a\uff08\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6279\uff09", "text": "\u6839\u636e\u4e2d\u56fd\u592a\u5e73\u4fdd\u9669\u96c6\u56e2\u5173\u4e8e\u6821\u56ed\u62db\u8058\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7ba1\u7406\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5f00\u5e73\u7b49\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u62e9\u4f18\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6821\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u9009\u62d4\uff0c\u73b0\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6279\u62df\u5f55\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u6821\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u516c\u793a(\u540d\u5355\u9644\u540e)\uff0c\u516c\u793a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a2021\u5e7412\u670820\u65e5-2021\u5e7412\u670824\u65e5\uff0c\u671f\u95f4\u5982\u5bf9\u62df\u5f55\u7528\u4eba\u5458\u6709\u5f02\u8bae\uff0c\u8bf7\u5411\u4e2d\u56fd\u592a\u5e73\u4fdd\u9669\u96c6\u56e2\u6709\u9650\u8d23\u4efb\u516c\u53f8\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u90e8/\u515a\u59d4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u3002\n\u8054\u7cfb\u7535\u8bdd\uff1a0755-88311685\n\u76d1\u7763\u90ae\u7bb1\uff1arenzibu@cntaiping.com\n\u9644\u4ef6\uff1a\n\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6279\u62df\u5f55\u7528\u9ad8\u6821\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u60c5\u51b5\n", "line": "soe", "url": "http://www.cntaiping.com/news/86290.html", "sentiment_pos": 0.76574, "sentiment_neg": 0.23426, "sentiment": "Positive", "energy": 0.0001956500782398, "materials": 0.0001141927059506, "industrials": 0.5324976444244385, "consumer_discretionary": 0.0866933092474937, "consumer_staples": 0.000295007484965, "health_care": 0.0001237690739799, "financials": 0.0426988415420055, "information_technology": 0.0107280705124139, "communication_services": 0.0552480518817901, "utilities": 0.0160062331706285, "real_estate": 0.0016160736558958, "sector": "Industrials", "relevance_score": 0.051384043, "relevant": false, "importance": 1, "importance1_score": 0.956820645182778, "importance2_score": 0.5413015649082621, "importance3_score": 0.5992639974133789, "importance4_score": 0.3996603228762175, "importance5_score": 0.0380577460210488, "market_positive_score": -0.8570465, "market_neutral_score": 2.8880448, "market_negative_score": -1.2053318, "market_sentiment": "Neutral", "en_title": "China Taiping Insurance Group's 2021 Fall Campus Recruitment Plan to Hire College Graduates Announcement (Second Batch)", "en_text": "According to the relevant management requirements of China Taiping Insurance Group on campus recruitment, the selection of college graduates is carried out through openness, equality, and competition.

Opinions on Accelerating the Construction of a Large National Market\", \"Guiding Opinions on Further Improving the Efficiency of Government Supervision and Promoting High-quality Development\", \"Several Opinions on Further Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines\", \"Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Ethical Governance of Science and Technology\" Guiding Opinions\" and \"Opinions on Promoting the Development of Individual Pensions\". When chairing the meeting, Xi Jinping emphasized that the development of the socialist market economy is a great creation of our party. The key is to properly handle the relationship between the government and the market, so that the market can play a decisive role in resource allocation and the government can better play its role. To build a new development pattern, there is an urgent need to speed up the construction of an efficient, standardized, fair competition, and fully open national unified large market, establish a unified national market system and rules, and promote the smooth flow of commodity factor resources on a larger scale. It is necessary to speed up the transformation of government functions, improve the efficiency of government supervision, promote a better combination of effective markets and promising governments, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises and the safety of people's lives and property in accordance with the law. It is necessary to highlight the orientation of cultivating first-class talents, serving the national strategic needs, and striving for world-class development, deepening the reform of systems and mechanisms, and making overall plans to promote and classify the construction of first-class universities and first-class disciplines. Science and technology ethics is a value criterion that scientific and technological activities must abide by. It is necessary to adhere to the principles of enhancing human well-being, respecting the right to life, fairness and justice, reasonably controlling risks, and maintaining openness and transparency. cultural concepts and safeguard mechanisms. It is necessary to promote the development of personal pensions that are suitable for China's national conditions, supported by government policies, voluntary participation of individuals, and market-oriented operations, and connect with basic old-age insurance and enterprise (occupational) annuities to realize the supplementary function of old-age insurance. Li Keqiang, Wang Huning and Han Zheng, members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and deputy directors of the Central Committee for Comprehensively Deepening Reform, attended the meeting. The meeting pointed out that since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the CPC Central Committee has adhered to the direction of socialist market economic reform, promoted market-oriented reform in breadth and depth, reduced the government's direct allocation of resources, and reduced the government's direct intervention in microeconomic activities, and continued to improve Institutions such as property rights protection, market access, fair competition, etc., promote price reform and market-oriented reform of important production factors such as land, capital, labor, technology, knowledge, and data, strengthen anti-monopoly and anti-unfair competition, and strive to remove market barriers and improve The efficiency and fairness of resource allocation, accelerate the formation of a modern market system in which enterprises operate independently, compete fairly, consumers freely choose and consume independently, and commodities and factors flow freely and exchange equally. At the same time, my country's market system still has outstanding problems such as insufficient uniformity of institutional rules, poor flow of factor resources, local protection and market segmentation. The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to focus on system construction, adhere to both standing and breaking, and improve the basic system and rules of the market, promote high-standard connectivity of market facilities, accelerate the construction of factor and resource markets, promote high-level unification of commodity and service markets, and improve regulatory governance. Effective policies and measures shall be introduced to continuously improve the uniformity of policies, the consistency of rules, and the coordination of implementation, so as to unify the large market and gather resources, promote growth, stimulate innovation, optimize the division of labor, and promote competition. It is necessary to speed up the elimination of various regulations and practices that hinder a unified market and fair competition. It is necessary to combine the implementation of major regional strategies and regional coordinated development strategies, give priority to the construction of a unified large market, and play a leading role in demonstration. The meeting pointed out that in order to improve the efficiency of government supervision, efforts should be made to solve the problems of \"who is in charge\", \"what is in charge\" and \"how to be in charge\". In accordance with the principle of \"who approves, who supervises, who is in charge, who supervises\", clarify the chain of responsibility, improve the efficiency of responsibility performance, and take responsibility seriously. Industry authorities should strictly implement their industry supervision responsibilities, relevant supervision departments should effectively perform their supervision responsibilities within their respective responsibilities, local governments should fully implement their territorial supervision responsibilities, and enterprises should strengthen self-management and self-discipline. For regulatory matters that involve multiple departments, are difficult to manage, and have prominent risks and hidden dangers, it is necessary to establish and improve a comprehensive cross-departmental regulatory system, and to improve a coordinated regulatory mechanism in which each performs its own duties, assumes their own responsibilities, cooperates with each other, and manages them together.

responded to the changes in the century and the epidemic of the century, made new steps in building a new development pattern, achieved new results in high-quality development, and achieved a good start to the '14th Five-Year Plan'.\" At the recent Central Economic Work Conference, he reviewed the upcoming At the end of 2021, General Secretary Xi Jinping said this. Over the past year, China's economy has handed over an extremely difficult report card with outstanding highlights - China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control have maintained a leading position in the world, the national strategic scientific and technological strength has been accelerated, the resilience of the industrial chain has been improved, and reform and opening up has advanced in depth. , people's livelihood protection is effective and effective, and the construction of ecological civilization continues to advance. The Central Economic Work Conference pointed out that \"while fully affirming the achievements, we must see that my country's economic development is facing the triple pressure of demand contraction, supply shock, and weakening expectations.\" Under the impact of the epidemic in the century, the evolution of the century-old changes has accelerated, and the external environment has become more complex and severe. and not sure. Affected by the new crown pneumonia epidemic, especially the mutant strains, global production and logistics have been hit one after another, inflation pressure in major countries has increased, and the ultra-loose policies of developed countries may have strong negative spillovers, unilateralism, protectionism, populism. rise. From a domestic perspective, the main contradiction facing China's economic operation is the supply side. The sluggish national economy and industrial circulation are the prominent contradictions currently facing. The growth momentum of consumption and investment has weakened, and the cost pressure of enterprises has increased. The hidden risks in the economic and financial fields cannot be ignored. Periodic structural cyclical factors are intertwined. These difficulties have put forward higher requirements for China's economy to \"cultivate new opportunities in the midst of crises, and open up new situations in changing situations\". \"We must face up to the difficulties and strengthen our confidence.\" The statement of the Central Economic Work Conference was sonorous and forceful. Time and momentum are on our side, and this is where China's strength and confidence lie. It should be noted that China has been the world's second largest economy, the second largest consumer market, the largest manufacturing country, the largest country in goods trade, and the largest country in foreign exchange reserves for many consecutive years, and will become the largest foreign capital inflow country in 2020; China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, and complete supporting capabilities. It has more than 150 million market entities, more than 170 million highly educated or possessing various professional skills, and more than 400 million people. The super-large domestic demand market formed by a population of more than 1.4 billion including the middle-income group is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, and the potential for investment demand is huge. The fundamentals of China's economic stability and long-term improvement have not changed. The basic characteristics of China's economy with sufficient potential, great resilience, strong vitality, large room for manoeuvre, and many policy tools have not changed. China's development has many advantages and conditions. Change. China, which has a stable \"chassis\", is still strong despite hard work, and is never afraid of challenges and problems. How to deal with risk challenges? The Central Economic Work Conference gave the answer: we must adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, we must adhere to high-quality development, we must insist on making progress while maintaining stability, and we must strengthen overall planning and coordination. These \"four musts\" are the regular understanding of economic work that our party has further accumulated in the practice of coping with risks and challenges. They are an important epistemology and methodology for doing a good job in economic work. , Enhanced strategic focus. How to navigate new major theoretical and practical issues? The Central Economic Work Conference pointed out the direction: we must correctly understand and grasp the strategic goals and practical ways to achieve common prosperity, correctly understand and grasp the characteristics and behavioral laws of capital, correctly understand and grasp the supply guarantee of primary products, and correctly understand and grasp the prevention and resolution of major problems. Risks, correct understanding and grasp of carbon peak carbon neutrality. These five aspects are not only major practical problems that must be faced and urgently solved, but also forward-looking, strategic and long-term. On the new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way and marching towards the second centenary goal, there is the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core and the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. China's significant institutional advantages and strong material and technological foundation, super-large-scale market advantages and domestic demand potential, and huge human capital and human resources, no matter how the international situation changes, as long as we unswervingly do our own thing, China's economic ship will be fixed. Able to go steadily and far and go forward.

Yangmao Expressway connects Yangjiang and Maoming, with an average daily traffic flow of nearly 50,000 vehicles, and a maximum of about 135,000 vehicles during peak hours. After the opening of the eight-lane traffic, the project will further open up the transportation artery for the integration of western Guangdong into the construction of the Greater Bay Area, accelerate the development and construction of the coastal area in western Guangdong, drive the cultivation of new economic growth poles, and help Guangdong build a \"one core, one belt, one district\" development. Layout is important. It is worth mentioning that the tourism resources along the Yangmao Expressway are very rich, especially the hot springs, ocean and island scenery. Driving on the Yangmao Expressway, you can easily reach the famous saltwater mineral hot springs, Moon Bay, Fangji Island, Romantic Coast and other scenic spots. You can also enjoy the national geographical indication products such as Chengcun oysters, goose rice, rice cakes and other delicacies .

On December 16, writer Zheng Yuanjie posted on Weibo that the publication of \"The King of Fairy Tales\" will be discontinued in January 2022, because \"the energy is limited, and we can only fight against multiple registered trademarks by stopping writing\". Founded in 1985, it has been in circulation for 36 years, published 495 issues, and sold more than 200 million copies... Zheng Yuanjie has created a fairy tale miracle for children's books with one person. The lively and cheerful Pipilu taught us to pursue justice, and the brave and fearless Shuke and Beta taught us to be kind. \"Fairy Tale King\" is like a spark, igniting \"our story\", building people's warm memories, carrying the great Many people's childhood feelings, it is not difficult to understand people's reluctance and regret. If the fact that the publication is suspended is emotionally difficult to accept, then the reason for the suspension is obviously very weak - writers must go all out to defend their rights. It is reported that Zheng Yuanjie has suffered from the stubborn disease of malicious squatting trademark registration for many years, and the number of squatting registrations is as high as more than 1,000. The three registered trademarks that directly led to the suspension of \"Fairy Tale King\" have cost Zheng Yuanjie a total of 32 years, but they have not successfully defended their rights so far. For literary creation, malicious squatting and infringement not only consume a lot of energy of the writer, but also hurt the writer's enthusiasm for originality. If the characters that he has worked so hard to create always become the possessions of others, I am afraid that there will no longer be writers who focus on creation. Registering a trademark in advance can effectively avoid such risks, but how can a writer who blindly blames prolific writers quickly register a trademark, how can they ensure that they are full of creative energy? Besides, there are all kinds of trademark names that have been maliciously squatted, and it is neither realistic nor necessary to try to register all relevant trademarks in advance. Instead of focusing on the various preventive efforts of creators, it is better to take a multi-pronged approach to accelerate the high-quality development of intellectual property protection with comprehensive measures. \"I want to use the method of suspending the publication of \"Fairy Tale King\" to awaken everyone's attention to protecting intellectual property rights in the field of trademarks.

Fortunately, I got training in the melting pot of the army and gradually grew into a glorious literary and art worker. Now I am teaching and educating people in colleges and universities, all because I have caught up with a great era. I deeply realize that for a young person to grow and become a talent, it is inseparable from the prosperity of the country, the revitalization of the nation and the cultivation of the people. Young literary and art workers must base themselves on the new era, learn from the people down-to-earth, hone their professional skills in life, make good use of new technical means, and be good at pioneering and innovating. It is necessary to have a correct attitude and fasten the first \"button\" for literature and art. Art educators should stand at the forefront of the times and think about education issues from the macro background of national development, be a good ladder for the growth of young literary and artistic talents, provide good services, and truly recognize, love, respect and use talents. talent.

century-old success", "en_text": "The glorious history and successful experience of the Communist Party of China in the past century tell us that the Communists of China rely on learning to get to today, and they must also rely on learning to move forward into the future. In the process of studying party history, I was delighted to read the new book \"Mastering the \"Housekeeping Skills\" by Sun Zhengyu, a senior professor at Jilin University, published by Jilin People's Publishing House. Although this is a \"small book\" with 120,000 fonts, it has quite rich theoretical connotations. This \"Everybody's Little Book\" has the following distinctive features, making it a rare theoretical masterpiece. First, this new book takes the 100-year history of the Chinese Communist Party as the main line, and clearly explains the \"housekeeping skills\" of our Party from victory to victory. Important issues such as why the Communist Party can, why Marxism works, and why socialism with Chinese characteristics is good. The opening of the book quotes General Secretary Xi Jinping's classic exposition: \"Our party has always attached great importance to the study of the whole party, especially leading cadres. This is a successful experience in promoting the development of the party and the people's cause.\" The inseparable connection between the great cause and the creative learning and application of Marxism has made a more thorough scientific revelation than ever before: \"The history of our party is a history of continuously promoting the Sinicization of Marxism, and a history of continuously promoting theoretical innovation. , the history of theoretical creation.\" This new book is based on this important exposition of General Secretary Xi Jinping. Second, this new work systematically explains the Marxist view of the Chinese Communists. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, \"To earnestly study Marxist theory, this is the housekeeping skill for us to do all work well, and it is also the housekeeping skill that leading cadres must generally master to win the work.\" The book focuses on the four unique characteristics of Marxist theory, namely, scientific, popular, practical, and open, and then answers the basic question of why it is necessary to master the \"housekeeping skills\" of Marxism. Marxism is a scientific theory, which creatively reveals the laws of development of human society; Marxism is a theory of the people, which for the first time created the ideological system for the people to achieve their own liberation; Marxism is a theory of practice, guiding the people's actions to transform the world ; Marxism is a continuously developing open theory, always standing at the forefront of the times. To master the \"housekeeping skills\" of Marxism, it is necessary to take \"scientific theory\", \"people's theory\", \"practice theory\" and \"continuously developing open theory\" as the substantive content, and deeply understand and deeply appreciate the greatness of Marxism. The power of truth and the mighty vitality. Third, the book expounds how to \"read the original work and understand the principles\" and how to master the \"housekeeping skills\" of Marxism. Based on the experience and experience of many years of research, the author points out a scientific path on how to \"read the original work\": read the \"Complete Works of Marx and Engels\" to grasp the theoretical system of Marxism as a whole; read \"The Selected Works of Marx and Engels\" to comprehend the basics of Marxism ideologically Principles; in-depth study of \"famous articles\", to grasp the core ideas of Marxism from the point of view; to explore \"viewpoints\", to understand the connotation of Marxist ideas theoretically; to master \"methods\", to apply Marxist theoretical thinking in practice. Based on the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech, the author also pointed out the basic concepts and basic principles of nine aspects of the \"Principle of Understanding\", namely, the historical materialism, the people's subject, the dialectical relationship between productive forces and production relations, the people's democracy, culture The concept of construction, the concept of social construction, the concept of ecological civilization, the concept of world history, and the concept of new political parties. The Marxist theoretical system is broad and profound, rich in content, and complex in system. How can we find a way to get started and to go deeper? For the cadres and the masses, this is not a problem that can be easily solved. This new book points out a simple and easy way for everyone to get started, and it is also an in-depth way to unify knowledge and action. Fourth, this is a popular reading material that can be enjoyed by both the refined and the popular, which is convenient for the general cadres and the masses to read. Road to simplicity. The author adopts the narration method in simple language, just like talking with one's heart. For general readers of the classics of Marxism-Leninism, this is a good guide for getting started, and it can be used as a necessary and useful book for opening books. For the majority of young students, it has a more fascinating ideological inspiration.

"en_text": "Nanfang Daily commentator On December 15, the Guangdong Provincial Government held a press conference to introduce the relevant situation of the \"Implementation Opinions on the Comprehensive Implementation of the Forest Chief System\". This is a powerful measure to implement the major decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and is of great significance to promoting ecological civilization and the construction of a beautiful Guangdong in our province. The full implementation of the forest chief system is a major decision and deployment made by General Secretary Xi Jinping from the strategic perspective of harmonious coexistence between man and nature and accelerating the construction of ecological civilization. . The Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China clearly put forward the \"implementation of the forest chief system\", and the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council issued the \"Opinions on the Comprehensive Implementation of the Forest Chief System\", which pointed out the way forward and clarified the ideas for action. All departments throughout the province must deeply understand that the \"Implementation Opinions\" is an important measure to thoroughly study and implement Xi Jinping's ecological civilization thought, and to implement the spirit of the General Secretary's series of important speeches and important instructions to Guangdong. A powerful starting point for realizing and creating a strategic fulcrum for a new development pattern is an action guide for us to promote the modernization of forestry governance systems and governance capabilities, and to open up a new situation in forest and grassland resource protection and management. Come up, use the \"Lin Chief System\" to promote \"Lin Changzhi\", and strive to be at the forefront of the country like the full implementation of the River Chief System and the Lake Chief System. Guangdong is a major forestry province with \"seven mountains, one water and two fields\". As early as 2019, our province tried to carry out the pilot forest chief system. Since this year, 13 prefecture-level cities have issued implementation (work) plans, accumulating valuable experience for our province to fully implement the forest chief system. On this basis, the \"Implementation Opinions\" clarifies that by 2025, a five-level forest chief system with a smooth operation mechanism will be fully established, and by 2035, the full implementation of the forest chief system will be more effective, which clarifies the tasks for us. Books, timetables, roadmaps. The whole province must adhere to the principle of giving priority to ecology, focusing on protection, green development, benefiting the people with ecology, problem-oriented, adapting measures to local conditions, leading the party committee, and the principle of inter-departmental linkage. The core of the forest chief system is the responsibility system. The full implementation of the forest chief system is to build a responsibility system and working mechanism in which the party and the government have the same responsibility, territorial responsibility, departmental coordination, source governance, and global coverage, so as to realize \"mountains are managed, trees are protected, and responsibilities are shouldered.\" Since the beginning of this year, Guangdong has insisted on placing the forest chief system in an important position. The main responsible comrades of the party committee and the government are the chief forest chiefs. The work idea of responsibility and high-level promotion. Stepping into a new stage of development, what and how the forest chief should do it, the main party and government leaders at all levels must be clear and in place, jump out of the traditional thinking of departments focusing on forests and grasses, and forests and grasses, and integrate forests and grasses into economic and social coordination. Focus on the important content of development, comprehensively establish a five-level forest chief system of provinces, cities, counties, towns and villages that integrates regions and natural ecosystems, clarify the forest chiefs' responsibilities for the protection and development of forest and grassland resources, strengthen work measures, and coordinate all forces. Formation of a work pattern of first-level focus on first-level and layer-by-layer implementation. The full implementation of the forest chief system is a complex and systematic project. It is a cross-level, cross-departmental, and cross-regional project. It involves a lot of content and shoulders heavy tasks. It is necessary to be good at grasping the key points and clarifying the key points. Focusing on the seven main tasks deployed in the \"Implementation Opinions\", we must strictly implement the supervision of forest and grassland resources, carry out high-quality ecological restoration of forest and grassland resources, build a natural reserve system with national parks as the main body, and strictly implement forest and grassland resources disaster prevention. Control, innovatively promote the informationization of forest chief system, comprehensively deepen forestry reform, and strengthen grass-roots infrastructure. To promote the effective implementation of the forest chief system, it is necessary to strengthen the mechanism guarantee, optimize the precise service, and provide a strong guarantee for the full implementation of the forest chief system through four measures: strengthening organizational leadership, improving the guarantee mechanism, strengthening supervision and participation, and strictly supervising and evaluating. Special emphasis should be placed on strengthening financial security, establishing an assessment index system for the forest chief system, and implementing a lifelong accountability system for leading party and government officials for ecological and environmental damage, so as to promote the effective implementation of the work. Forests and grasslands are important natural ecosystems, which play a fundamental and strategic role in maintaining national ecological security and promoting ecological civilization construction. The whole province must thoroughly study and implement Xi Jinping's thought on ecological civilization, actively practice the concept that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets, promptly improve the supporting systems of the forest chief system, promote the construction of forest chiefs benefiting the people and green gardens, and create forest chief reform demonstration areas. Continuously improve the ecological well-being of the people, create high-quality southern Guangdong and beautiful mountains and rivers, and provide strong ecological support for the construction of beautiful Guangdong and the early realization of the modernization of harmonious coexistence between man and nature."}, {"date": "2021-12-15", "title":

both men and women to make gifts during their relationship. Can the donor get support when the donor asks the other party to return the property after the relationship ends? A few days ago, a local court heard a case of such a gift contract dispute. Ten months after the plaintiff Yuan and the defendant Zhu established a relationship, they broke up due to trivial matters. During the exchange, Yuan gave Zhu a reward of more than 52,000 yuan through a certain platform, paid Zhu more than 133,000 yuan through Alipay and WeChat, and purchased items worth more than 53,000 yuan for Zhu on JD.com and other websites. At the same time, during the period of communication, in addition to daily small transfers to Yuan, Zhu gave a total of more than 70,200 yuan in large rebates. After the trial, the court held that the money paid by the plaintiff Yuan to the live broadcast platform should be regarded as the due benefits obtained by the defendant Zhu through his own labor. For Yuan to the defendant repeatedly through WeChat, Alipay, or a large amount of small sums of money, such as shopping, ordering takeaways, etc., there are also sums with special meanings such as \"52\", \"520\", \"1314\", etc., it should be regarded as the expression of both parties. The gift of love is a general gift; the large amount of money transferred from Yuan to Zhu or the amount of shopping has exceeded the scope of daily exchanges between men and women. Conditional civil juristic acts, namely conditional gift contracts, should be returned by the recipient once the conditions for the validity of the gift contract have not been fulfilled. However, in the interaction between Zhu and Yuan, in addition to several small transfers and shopping rebates to the plaintiff, he also transferred more than 70,200 yuan to the plaintiff, which exceeded the amount paid by Yuan, and it should be deemed that Zhu has Yuan's conditional gift was returned. Therefore, the court ruled to reject Yuan's claim. [Judge's Analysis] Article 657 of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China stipulates: \"A gift contract is a contract in which the donor gives his property to the donee free of charge, and the donee expresses his acceptance of the gift.\" Article 661 stipulates: \"The gift can be Obligations.\u201d During the period of love or the existence of the marriage contract, the mutual gift of property that does not exceed a reasonable range should be regarded as a general gift. Once the property is handed over, the gift contract will be established and become effective. Revocation of the gift and requiring the recipient to return the gifted property; for the part of the gift with a large amount that obviously exceeds the normal expenses during the period of communication between the two parties, it is different from the general gift of property. Although the two parties did not express it when the gift contract was established, both parties understood The gift of a large amount of property implies the good wishes of both parties to conclude a marriage or live together in the future. This wish is the purpose of the parties to establish the legal relationship of the gift. The conclusion of marriage or living together is an uncertain future that may occur. The fact is that the gift contract of both parties is actually attached with a termination condition, and the gift contract becomes invalid when the conditions are fulfilled (both parties cannot conclude a marriage or live together), and the donee should return the gifted property to the donor."}, {"date": "2021-12-15", "title": "\u8003\u53e4\u91cd\u5927\u53d1\u73b0\u4e4b\u540e\u662f\u4fdd\u62a4", "text": "\u25a0\u4e01\u5efa\u5ead\n12\u670814\u65e5\uff0c\u56fd\u5bb6\u6587\u7269\u5c40\u516c\u5e03\u6c49\u5510\u65f6\u671f\u4e09\u9879\u91cd\u8981\u8003\u53e4\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6700\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u662f\u786e\u8ba4\u9655\u897f\u7701\u897f\u5b89\u5e02\u767d\u9e7f\u539f\u6c5f\u6751\u5927\u5893\u5373\u4e3a\u6c49\u6587\u5e1d\u9738\u9675\u3002\n\u5343\u5e74\u4e4b\u8c1c\uff0c\u7ec8\u4e8e\u63ed\u5f00\u4e86\u8c1c\u5e95\uff01\u8fd9\u6b21\u8003\u53e4\u53d1\u73b0\u5426\u5b9a\u4e86\u5143\u4ee3\u4ee5\u6765\u4e16\u4f20\u7684\u201c\u51e4\u51f0\u5634\u201d\u4e3a\u6c49\u6587\u5e1d\u9738\u9675\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u9738\u9675\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u897f\u6c49\u5341\u4e00\u9675\u7684\u540d\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u56fd\u53e4\u4ee3\u5e1d\u738b\u9675\u5893\u5236\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u6781\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u505a\u597d\u9738\u9675\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u3002\n\u9738\u9675\u53d1\u73b0\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u7f51\u53cb\u60ca\u53f9\u767d\u9e7f\u539f\u662f\u4e00\u7247\u201c\u795e\u5947\u7684\u571f\u5730\u201d\uff0c\u8fd8\u5efa\u8bae\u201c\u89c4\u5212\u65c5\u6e38\u7ebf\u8def\u201d\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u89c4\u5212\u65c5\u6e38\u666f\u533a\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002\u9738\u9675\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8d77\u521d\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u76d7\u5893\u8d3c\u7684\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u540e\u9762\u88ab\u8feb\u8fdb\u884c\u62a2\u6551\u6027\u53d1\u6398\u6240\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u8003\u53e4\u6210\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e74\uff0c\u9675\u5893\u88ab\u76d7\u6848\u4ecd\u65f6\u6709\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u94b1\u9560\u5893\u76d7\u6398\u6848\u7b49\uff0c\u4e00\u518d\u63d0\u9192\u6211\u4eec\u6587\u7269\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0d\u53ef\u6389\u4ee5\u8f7b\u5fc3\uff0c\u6bd4\u6316\u6398\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\n\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5c5e\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c5e\u4e8e\u5b50\u5b59\u540e\u4ee3\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6c49\u6587\u5e1d\u9738\u9675\u5b9e\u5c5e\u4e0d\u6613\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u662f\u4efb\u91cd\u9053\u8fdc\u3002\n\u76f8\u5173\u62a5\u9053\u89c1A11\u7248\u25b6", "line": "official", "url": "http://epaper.southcn.com/nfdaily/html/2021-12/15/content_7977621.htm", "sentiment_pos": 0.959858, "sentiment_neg": 0.0401421, "sentiment": "Positive", "energy": 3.2617521355859935e-05, "materials": 0.0014915186911821, "industrials": 0.2080343067646026, "consumer_discretionary": 0.6699729561805725, "consumer_staples": 0.0020989819895476, "health_care": 0.010769666172564, "financials": 0.0001933392195496, "information_technology": 0.0011608867207542, "communication_services": 0.0099771963432431, "utilities": 0.0029675371479243, "real_estate": 0.0120783513411879, "sector": "Consumer Discretionary", "relevance_score": 0.04391096, "relevant": false, "importance": 3, "importance1_score": 0.7808741405061063, "importance2_score": 0.7741163412162343, "importance3_score": 0.8559726563700762, "importance4_score": 0.5424473225507648, "importance5_score": 0.0348103816587914, "market_positive_score": 2.3847735, "market_neutral_score": 1.4151375, "market_negative_score": -3.4171052, "market_sentiment": "Positive", "en_title": "Archaeological finds followed by conservation", "en_text": "\u25a0Ding Jianting On December 14, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage announced three important archaeological discoveries in the Han and Tang Dynasties, among which the most concerned is the confirmation that the tomb of Jiangcun in Bailuyuan, Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province is the Mausoleum of Emperor Hanwen. The thousand-year-old mystery has finally been revealed! This archaeological discovery denies the traditional cognition that the \"Phoenix Mouth\" has been handed down since the Yuan Dynasty as the Paling Mausoleum of Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty. The mausoleum system is of great significance, and it also contributes to the protection and development of Ba Mausoleum. After the discovery of Baling, many netizens marveled that Bailuyuan was a \"magical land\" and suggested \"planning tourist routes\". In fact, the next more important task is to protect, not to plan the development of tourist attractions. The discovery of Baling was initially due to the destruction of tomb robbers, and was later forced to carry out salvage excavations. In recent years, the robbery of mausoleums still occurs from time to time, such as the robbery of Qian Liu\u2019s tomb, which reminds us repeatedly that the protection of cultural relics should not be taken lightly, and that protection is more important than excavation and development. Historical and cultural heritage belongs not only to us, but also to future generations. It is not easy to discover the Tomb of Emperor Hanwen, and the protection work is a long way to go.

Plaza. Photo by Huang Weixing The continuous struggle in the past five years has made Dongguan's economy and society develop by leaps and bounds, and the new starting point of \"double 10,000\" is within reach. The past five years are the five years for Dongguan's comprehensive strength to achieve a great leap - significant progress has been made in deepening reform and opening up, major breakthroughs have been made in innovation-driven development, industrial development advantages have been significantly consolidated, urban quality connotation has been steadily improved, and ecological environment quality has continued to improve. People's livelihood and social undertakings are striding forward... As the 15th Party Congress of Dongguan is about to be held, let us take stock of Dongguan on the five-year list. Lists and honors are showing Dongguan, which is about to enter the critical stage of the new starting point of \"Double 10,000\" in an all-round and multi-angle manner. Written by: He Qiying, Gong Mingyang, Jin Yanming, Guo Wenjun, in the name of the city, showed his strength and the Dongjiang tossed, witnessing the rising stars of Nanyue science and technology innovation; In September this year, the 18th issue of \"Seeking Truth\" in 2021 published the \"Statistical Chart of Economic and Social Development: Basic Population of Super Large and Super Large Cities in the Seventh National Census\" provided by the National Bureau of Statistics. According to the census data, Dongguan has been promoted to become one of the 14 megacities in the country, ranking second among megacities. Tens of millions of people coexist and prosper with Dongguan, and jointly create a strong and indomitable Dongguan. In the eyes of the outside world, Dongguan has many labels: \"China's Top 100 Foreign Trade Cities\", \"Mega City\" and \"New First-tier City\", but this is only the tip of the iceberg. In recent years, Dongguan has repeatedly been \"out of the circle\" on major lists: with the city's famous comprehensive strength - 2021 China's urban comprehensive economic competitiveness ranked 17th; 2021 China's urban sustainable competitiveness ranked 13th; 2021 Ranked 19th among the top 100 cities for advanced manufacturing industries; the intensive land use, environmental governance, financial budgeting, commercial system reform, and stabilization of foreign trade fundamentals have been supervised and motivated by the State Council. GDP is about to hit the trillion mark, and high-quality development is going steadily and far. What cannot be ignored is the continuous efforts of 33 towns and streets (parks) in Dongguan. Fashion in Humen, woolen weaving in Dalang, metal molds in Chang'an, shoemaking in Houjie, furniture in Dalingshan... When it comes to every town street (park), one or two advantageous industries can always be thought of, and people will be pleasantly surprised. Discover the industrial cluster characteristics of \"one town, one product\" in Dongguan. This has long been reflected in the list. In the 2021 Top 100 List of Top 1000 Towns with Comprehensive Strength in China in the \"Research Results Release of High-Quality Development Index of Small and Medium-sized Cities in China in 2021\", 15 towns in Dongguan rank among the whole country.

The scattered towns and streets (parks) are like little stars, converging into a prosperous and prosperous footprint, helping Dongguan to move towards a new starting point of \"double 10,000\". To take a leading position in the competition of urban development, technology is the first element. In the past five years, Songshan Lake Science City has been included in the pioneering area of the comprehensive national science center in the Greater Bay Area; in the past five years, the only pulsed spallation neutron source in the country and the fourth in the world has been built and operated; in the past five years, the Greater Bay Area University , City University of Hong Kong (Dongguan) have settled in one after another... In November this year, the Institute of Financial and Economic Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the China Social Sciences Press jointly released the \"China City Competitiveness Report No. Among them, Dongguan entered the top 20 national science and technology innovation, ranking third in prefecture-level cities, jumping from the 40th to the 20th in the country. In the \"National Innovative City Innovation Capability Monitoring Report 2020\" and \"National Innovative City Innovation Capability Evaluation Report 2020\" published by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the China Institute of Science and Technology Information, Dongguan's national innovative city innovation capability ranks 22nd. The \"big leap\" of the science and technology list comes from Dongguan's forward-looking vision of technological innovation and advanced manufacturing to lead economic development. With the continuous stimulation of new vitality, Songshan Lake Science City has shown a strong siphon effect to the outside world, and more high-level talents and high-level projects have been continuously gathered. Songshan Lake Science City has become a powerful engine driving the high-level development of Dongguan's scientific and technological innovation. One of the first four provincial laboratories in Guangdong Province to start construction, the Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory established in 2018, is located in Songshan Lake Science City, where many \"strongest brains\" are hidden. It is reported that the laboratory currently has 8 academicians of the \"two academies\", and the research results have been selected into the \"Top Ten Progress in China's Science\" and \"China's Major Technological Progress\" for two consecutive years. The laboratory has introduced more than 900 talents in total. At present, it has introduced 25 high-level research teams and incubated 26 industrialized companies. R&D (scientific research and experimental development) accounts for the second largest proportion of GDP in the province; the number of national high-tech enterprises exceeds 7,200, ranking first in prefecture-level cities in the province; 79 enterprises have been rated as national-level specialized, special and new \"little giants\" Enterprise, ranking ninth in the country...

Show your charm with the beauty of life. Walking on the streets of Wanyi, decorated with flowers and lush greenery, you will encounter convenience stores beside the clean roads, and you can also invite friends and confidants, and drink a cup of fragrant coffee in the cafe on the corner. Living in Dongguan is convenient and comfortable. In January this year, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and the National Development and Reform Commission issued the \"Announcement on Naming the Tenth Batch (2020) of National Water-Saving Cities\", and Dongguan was listed as a \"National Water-Saving City\". In October, at the Ecological Civilization Forum of the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, Dongguan City was awarded the title of the fifth batch of \"National Ecological Civilization Construction Demonstration City\". So far, Dongguan has successively won the National Environmental Protection Model City, National Civilized City, National Sanitary City, National Forest City, National Greening Model City, National Water Ecological Civilization Pilot City, National Ecological Civilization Pilot Demonstration Zone, National Water-saving City, National Ecological City Civilization Construction Demonstration City and other honorary titles. The Huayang Lake in Mayong has been transformed from the \"Longxugou\" into a national wetland park, and the water quality and landscape of the coastal promenade, Maozhou River, Shima River and other watersheds have been improved. And \"high-value\" Dongguan has found its own \"way\" in social governance. The \"red stool\" leads social governance, the \"blue vest\" builds a safe line of defense, and the \"rural sage\" resolves disputes and contradictions... In Dongguan, with a large foreign population and mixed local accents, citizens can quickly gain a sense of belonging and find a \"harbor of home\". It is with these \"embroidery skills\" that it has condensed into the \"Guangdong version\" of social governance \"secrets\", making Dongguan stand out on this list. In September 2017, Dongguan achieved the highest honor of national comprehensive management of social security and safety construction - \"National Excellent City for Comprehensive Management of Social Security\" for three consecutive years. This honor is selected and commended every 4 years by the Ping An China Construction Coordination Group and the Central Political and Legal Committee. Places that have been rated as national excellent cities for three consecutive years will be awarded the \"Chang'an Cup\". So far, Dongguan City has achieved three consecutive championships in the \"National Excellent City for Comprehensive Management of Social Security\" and won the \"Chang'an Cup\" for the first time. It is worth mentioning that in 2020, Dongguan has achieved the \u201csix consecutive championships\u201d in the national model city of social governance innovation, continued to \u201clight up skills\u201d, and brought more \u201cgood ideas\u201d to social governance. With sincerity, it highlights that the gathering of gravitational talents is highly related to the city's economic development level, policies and supporting facilities. From the \"three to one supplement\" to attract Hong Kong and Taiwan businessmen to invest and start businesses in Dongguan, to China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) to gather scientific and technological talents to lead Dongguan's advanced manufacturing, the \"double improvement\" of economy and technology is inseparable from the talent attention and policy support. In Dongguan, business and business are not just words. In the \"2020 Business Environment Report of China's 296 Prefectural-level and Above Cities\" jointly released by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Research Institute and the 21st Century Economic Research Institute at the end of last year, Dongguan's business environment level ranked 18th in the country.

It can be seen that Dongguan's \"pro-enterprise and clean government\" has been rewarded, and it has truly achieved \"planting plane trees and attracting phoenixes\". In addition to the construction of the business environment, Dongguan is also telling the \"Dongguan Story\" to the outside world, and the city's soft power is constantly improving. For a long time, Dongguan has been affected by negative stereotypes, leaving the outside world with a \"first impression\" that is difficult to change easily. At the just-concluded first \"International Communication Forum of Chinese Cities\", the \"Analysis Report on the Overseas Influence of Chinese Cities (2021)\" was released. Activities such as the \"Draw Dongguan in Your Heart\" European Youth Painting Competition carried out during the promotion were selected as \"Characteristic Cases of International Communication in Chinese Cities\". In the \"This Is Dongguan\" series of city promotional videos, the sustainable development concept of \"industrial development can develop in harmony with ecological protection\" has been continuously quoted and reported by foreign media. The city's brand image has effectively enhanced the positive image of Dongguan. The results of the list are not castles in the air. Behind the fame, Dongguan has created great achievements with humility and hard work, telling the \"Dongguan story\" well in the accumulation of hard work, striding forward and running out of \"Dongguan speed\". Looking forward to the future, Dongguan is firmly taking the road of high-quality development in the new era, based on the new starting point of \"double 10,000\", focusing on technological innovation

A few days ago, the Hebei Provincial Market Supervision and Administration Bureau officially issued the \"Hebei Province Food Business Risk Classification Management Work Specification\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Work Specification\"). The \"Work Specification\" subdivides food operators into 11 types, formulates a quantitative score table for static risk factors and a quantitative score table for dynamic risk factors, and implements classification assessment. In terms of risk level classification, the \"Work Specification\" divides the risk level of food operators into four levels: A-level risk, B-level risk, C-level risk, and D-level risk. The municipal and county-level market supervision and management departments are responsible for the specific work of the grading management of food business risks in their respective regions. The county bureau adjusts the risk level of food operators based on the annual supervision and inspection records of food operators. In accordance with the principle of classified supervision, the \"Work Specification\" integrates the content of the daily supervision and inspection points table for different types of food operators and the dynamic risk value evaluation table of risk levels, realizing the integration of the two tables and improving the efficiency of supervision work. The \"Work Specification\" specifies the inspection frequency requirements for food operators with different risk levels. For food operators with risk level A, at least one supervision and inspection per year shall be conducted; for food operators with risk level B, supervision and inspection shall be conducted at least twice a year, and at least once every six months; For food operators with risk level C, at least 3 supervision and inspections are conducted every year, and at least once every 4 months; for food operators with risk level D, supervision and inspections are conducted at least 4 times a year and at least quarterly. 1 time.

without property", "en_text": "Zhu Rui Huinong District, Shizuishan City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is an old industrial base in Ningxia. There are many old residential areas in the city, and there are problems such as aging infrastructure and inability to meet the needs of owners, which has always been a difficulty in community governance. In order to solve the troubles of the masses and effectively solve the management problems of non-property communities, Huinong District closely adheres to the theme of \"multiple participation, negotiation and co-governance\", actively explores the management model of \"party building + autonomy + negotiation\" in non-property communities, and successfully opens up the non-property community The \"blocking point\" of community governance has effectively improved the happiness and satisfaction of the masses. Focusing on party building to lead Huinong District Adhering to the leadership of community governance by party building, giving play to the leading role of community party organizations in taking the lead and coordinating all parties, and continuously improving the ability of community party organizations to direct direction, make decisions, unify resources, and strengthen services in community governance . Establish the organizational structure of \"community party committee - community party branch - building party group - party member central household\", implement the system of \"dual report and double registration\", party member packaged households, party member point management and other systems, and promote community party organizations to extend the tentacles of party building work, Lay the foundation for the party organization to lead the masses, publicize the masses, unite the masses, and serve the masses. The Party branch of the park community played the role of a fighting fortress, coordinated and solved the heating contradiction of the old neighborhood community, and did practical things for the community residents; Huixi community, through the working mechanism of party members\u2019 package and household cooperation under the leadership of the community party organization, better solved the problem of 38 districts under its jurisdiction. There are no management issues in old residential areas, allowing residents to benefit from community governance. Develop \"red property\" Huinong District guides the community party branch to create \"red property\" through the method of \"two-way entry and cross-serving\". The district adopts the operation mode of \"Party Branch + Owner's Committee Preparatory Group\", and includes members of the community \"two committees\", old party members, and building bosses who are willing to contribute, have a certain spare time, and have a strong ability to perform their duties. Candidates are planning to set up a \"red industry committee\" to lay a solid foundation for the introduction of standardized management of property companies in non-property communities. At present, 22 new owners' committees have been established in the district, and 6 residential property companies including Linghang Xinyuan Community and Zhongjie Community have been introduced to manage them. For communities that do not have the ability to introduce property management for the time being, under the leadership of the community party organization, precise policy implementation, classified governance, and exploration and implementation of four management modes: community escrow, social organization service, owner committee autonomy, and residents' self-service have achieved the realization of no property management. The goal of the community is that \"the garbage will be cleaned, the sanitation will be cleaned, and the community will be managed\". Focus on \"discussion and negotiation\" In order to strengthen the tripartite negotiation and communication between the community, the property committee and the property management company, Huinong District relies on the \"Party and Mass Tongxin Garden\", \"Red Housekeeper's Council\", \"Pomegranate Pavilion Roundtable\", \"Community Bench Meeting\" and other community discussions The platform, formulate the residents' discussion system, and convene community party organizations, residents' committees, property companies, owners' committees, social organizations, co-construction units and other community governance parties to conduct regular discussions and consultations. It is up to the residents to decide. Through discussion and consultation, the district has solved a large number of problems closely related to residents' life, such as renovation of old residential areas, water supply and heating, garbage removal and transportation. For example, during the implementation of the government's old community renovation project, Zhongjie Community widely listened to residents' opinions and suggestions through the \"branch courtyard\", and revised and improved the construction plan to make the government's livelihood project more in line with public opinion; \"The Residents' Council has built a bridge for communication between residents and property service companies, and the level of property services has been effectively improved; Qiaoxi Community regularly holds a \"resident's council\" every month, which has resolved the distress and worries around a group of residents. Digging deeper and co-constructing Hui Nong District vigorously promoted the \"one book and three orders\", and deeply explored the advantages of co-resident and co-construction working mechanism. Each community signed 228 co-construction agreements with co-construction units, and sorted out the list of community co-construction and co-governance resources. The list of governance needs and service items will effectively connect various service resources in the community with the needs of the masses, integrate them organically, gather regional joint efforts, and form a community \u201cwhistle blowing\u201d and department \u201creporting\u201d mechanism. Through the \"Friday Volunteer Service Day\" in the whole district, in-service party members and volunteers went deep into the community and buildings to clean up the sanitary corners and small advertisements in the corridors and improve the environmental sanitation of the non-property community. At present, a total of more than 1,800 in-service party members have reported to the community one after another. The co-construction units actively participate in the co-construction and co-governance of the community, install leisure seats, add charging piles, set up barrier-free passages, maintain activity

65-year-old Lanzhou citizen, had mixed feelings in his heart. \"The 7-year wait has finally come to fruition, but I have a difficult problem.\" Mr. Li said. Mr. Li lives in Asia Pacific International Mansion, Chengguan District, Lanzhou City, Gansu Province. The building was completed in 2010 and was sold to the public. Due to the change of owners in real estate development, the payment of land transfer fees fell into disputes, and the real estate certificate was delayed. In 2014, Mr. Li purchased the property here. Since then, he, like other owners, has started a long and anxious wait. The expectations of the owners have echoed this year. In mid-July, the staff began to measure the area of the house. After that, declaration of materials, verification, and tax payment... Mr. Li finally got the real estate certificate that he had been waiting for for many years. The \"difficulty in registration\" of real estate caused by the problems left over from history affects people's settlement, children's schooling, and real estate sales. Since the beginning of this year, Gansu Province has focused on this problem, comprehensively surveyed, researched and analyzed, clarified the responsibilities of government departments, development and construction entities and house buyers, simplified handling procedures, clarified the time limit for tasks, and comprehensively used legal, market and other means to tackle difficulties to maximize protection. People's property rights. Up to now, Gansu Province has found more than 810,000 houses involving \"difficulty in registration\", and resolved more than 500,000 houses, with a resolution rate of over 60%. Lanzhou City, which has a large stock of real estate \"difficulty in registration\" problems, has implemented \"separation of certificate payment\", \"separation of certificate reform\" and \"separation of certificate review\" to separate and synchronize the processing of real estate property certificates for the masses, the collection of corporate taxes and fees, and special inspection and acceptance. Promoting and improving the efficiency. Jiayuguan City has adopted methods such as setting up special service windows, accepting on-site projects in submerged project communities, opening up \"green channels\", providing door-to-door services for people with disabilities, or coordinating centralized agencies in the community to ensure that the real estate registration of the masses is \"immediately done\". The relevant person in charge of the Natural Resources Department of Gansu Province said that the next step will be to accelerate the resolution of the problem and prevent the masses from \"paying\"

"Across the long river of history, the Chinese nation has never ceased to exist, and behind it is the tenacious struggle of generations. Among the countless strugglers, a large number of entrepreneurs with distinctive characteristics of the times, national characteristics, and world-class standards, cherished their homeland and country, took responsibility, and wrote a colorful chapter of entrepreneurship in the magnificent historical picture. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized: \"We must do everything possible to protect market players, stimulate the vitality of market players, promote entrepreneurship, promote enterprises to play a greater role and achieve greater development, and accumulate basic strength for economic development.\" Create brilliance. The entrepreneurial spirit of advancing with the times is motivating the vast number of entrepreneurs to overcome difficulties, climb the peak bravely, and strive to write a new chapter in the development of the new era. Home in my heart In Wanding, Yunnan, the monument to the return of overseas Chinese from Nanyang to fight against Japan stands majestically, silently telling the splendid years of more than 80 years ago. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the famous overseas Chinese leader Tan Kah Kee not only donated huge sums of money, but under his call, more than 3,000 overseas Chinese mechanics resolutely returned to China and went to the Yunnan-Myanmar Highway to transport anti-Japanese war materials. More than 1,000 overseas Chinese mechanics died on this road. superior. Taking the initiative to take responsibility for the country and share its worries for the country - this is the lofty sense of mission and strong sense of responsibility of outstanding entrepreneurs to the country and the nation. When the country was in crisis and the people needed it, they stepped forward, dedicated themselves, and made important contributions to the victory of the War of Resistance. The time has come to 2020, the virus has attacked, the new crown pneumonia epidemic is menacing, and people's lives and health are facing serious threats. A difficult one, P Plus support. All walks of life have shouldered their responsibilities, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises have walked side by side to fight the front line of epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production. China State Construction completed the construction tasks of Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals in 10 days and 12 days respectively; Zall Holdings and professional institutions quickly established a number of emergency hospitals; COSCO SHIPPING, COFCO, SF Express, JD.com and other companies worked day and night to make good progress Logistics support war; state-owned enterprises such as petroleum and petrochemicals, power grids and electric power did not stop working during the epidemic, and private enterprises such as information technology and equipment manufacturing resumed work and production in an orderly manner with \"points\" and \"chains\"... Entrepreneurial spirit, tempered in the big test; home and country Feelings are sublimated in the tempering. On the occasion of the centennial anniversary of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese nation ushered in another historical moment\u2014General Secretary Xi Jinping solemnly announced on behalf of the Party and the people that a moderately prosperous society has been built in all respects on the land of China, and the problem of absolute poverty has been solved historically. In this great anti-poverty struggle, companies with firm beliefs are charging forward and have the courage to take responsibility. - Do your best. Central enterprises have paired up to help more than 240 key counties in national poverty alleviation and development work, and private enterprises have \"10,000 enterprises help 10,000 villages\", working together to bring human, financial, material and other resources to the places where they are most needed. - Director of each exhibition. Through industrial poverty alleviation, health poverty alleviation, cultural poverty alleviation, etc., to drive poor households to get rid of poverty and increase income, strengthen fitness; innovate financial and insurance products, etc., to escort the economic and social development of the region... The decisive victory is to build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, the history is galloping forward, the entrepreneurial spirit is ever-lasting, and the strong force continues to emerge. Dare to be the first in the world One day in 1982, a thousand-person meeting was held in Xiaoshan, Zhejiang to convey the spirit of the central government. On the stage, \"Township and village enterprises can implement the contract system.\" Someone in the audience immediately stood up and said loudly, \"I want to contract!\" He was 37-year-old Lu Guanqiu. In 1983, Lu Guanqiu contracted the Wanxiang Joint Factory, the predecessor of Wanxiang Group. Today, Wanxiang Group has developed into an enterprise with an annual revenue of over 100 billion yuan. \"What is hidden and used is what can be left behind and hidden.\" Since the reform and opening up, the vast number of entrepreneurs have dared to think, dare to forge ahead, dare to be the first in the world, vigorously promote the spirit of innovation, and have contributed an important force to the world-renowned achievements of my country's economic development. Innovation is the inexhaustible driving force for enterprise development. General Secretary Xi Jinping once encouraged enterprises to \"have ambition and backbone to accelerate the enhancement of independent innovation capabilities and strength\". Milling 56 Chinese characters on a grain of rice, and milling 7 letters on a single strand of hair... China Tungsten Hi-Tech Jinzhou Company aims at the forefront of world science and technology, and successfully developed a very small diameter milling cutter with a diameter of 0.01 mm, which will greatly help Quality upgrades in electronic information, medical and other fields. From scratch, from weak to strong, spelling out a world - this is a vivid epitome of the innovation and development of Chinese enterprises, and it is a true portrayal of their high-quality economic development. Looking back at the early days of the founding of New China, my country's heavy industry was almost zero, light industry was only a small amount of textile industry, and people used \"foreign fire\", \"foreign oil\" and \"foreign nails\" on a daily basis. Not long after the founding of New China, my country established an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system. Entering a new era, my country has become the second largest economy in the world. Innovation releases vitality and innovation wins development. Each number confirms the vitality of Chinese enterprises and highlights the main position of innovation. From 76,000 to 275,000! \u2014\u2014During the \"13th Five-Year Plan\" period, the number of high-tech enterprises in the country jumped sharply; it exceeded 1.3 trillion yuan! \u2014\u2014The scale of R&D investment in the top 500 Chinese enterprises in 2021 has been rising steadily, and the R&D intensity has reached a record high; the ranking of innovation index has risen steadily for 9 consecutive years! \u2014\u2014The report released by the World Intellectual Property Organization shows that China's ranking has risen from the 35th in 2013 to the 12th in 2021... The innovation source of thousands of enterprises is constantly flowing, and the creative vitality is bursting out, converging to promote the economy The surging momentum of development. Strive to be first class \"Time is money, efficiency is life.\" In 1981, this giant placard stood in the most conspicuous place in Shenzhen Shekou Industrial Zone. These 12 words have a distinct imprint of the times, and are a vivid presentation of entrepreneurial spirit in the special economic zone. China Merchants Bank, the first joint-stock commercial bank founded by an enterprise in New China, and Ping An Insurance, the first commercial insurance institution founded by an enterprise in New China, were successively established in Shekou. After the baptism of reform and opening up, both companies have grown into the world's top 500 companies, and Shekou is therefore known as \"the place with the most well-known companies per unit area\". The years are changing, but the inheritance remains the same. Entrepreneurs with courage and innovation from generation to generation forge ahead bravely and strive to be first-class. Can sewage be heated? It sounds incredible. However, this technology has been applied and promoted in many areas of our country. As a specialized and new \"little giant\" enterprise, Harbin Institute of Technology Jintao Technology Co., Ltd. has been deeply involved in the field of clean energy for many years, extracting heat energy from sewage in urban sewage interception trunk canals, and delivering \"warmth\" to residents' homes, currently serving dozens of cities. Heating service is provided. Compared with the use of coal, the emission of pollutants such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide is reduced by more than 4.7 million tons per year. Small in scale, large in energy. 4,762 national-level specialized and special new \"little giant\" enterprises possess unique skills, and more and more enterprises have become \"single champions\" and \"unicorns\", just like a beautiful landscape. According to statistics from foreign institutions, among the more than 500 \"unicorn\" companies in the world in 2020, there are 112 in mainland my country, ranking second in number. Enterprises, regardless of size, do what they do best. A Fortune Global 500 list, witnessing the growth rate and ambition of Chinese companies - 20 years ago, there were only more than 10 Chinese companies on the list, and the number has risen year by year since then; two years ago, Chinese companies The number of 129 companies topped the list for the first time; in 2021, the number of shortlisted Chinese companies will increase to 143, continuing to lead. This is a nice upward curve. Since the list was published in 1995, no company from any other country or region has expanded its presence on the list at such a rapid rate as China. Guanshan has thousands of weights, and the heights of the mountains are man-made peaks. On the new journey, opportunities and challenges coexist.

January to October this year, Shandong Energy New Mining Group's cumulative coking clean coal yield was 71.67%, a year-on-year increase of 3.18%. These two figures are very eye-catching. In accordance with the strategic deployment requirements of the \"clean coal income increase\" of the New Mining Group, the coal washing branch continued to deepen the integrated operation of each coal washing plant, implemented technical upgrading and management integration, and achieved significant economic benefits. \"We have accelerated the implementation of key technical transformation projects for expert consultation, which has promoted a steady increase in the yield of clean coal and enhanced the core competitiveness of the company,\" said Xu Guangqian, deputy chief engineer of the Coal Washing Branch and director of the Technology R&D Department. According to the actual production, they have devoted themselves to tackling key domestic cutting-edge technologies such as \"heavy media without ash\", coal slime deep processing, and medium-sized coal deep processing, striving to the extreme, and providing high-quality washing services for all mines. The operation of the coal slime deep processing project of the Center and Xiezhuang Coal Washing Plant remained continuous and stable. Among them, the yields of high-sulfur and high-ash clean coal in the Xiezhuang Coal Washing Plant increased by 5.62% and 3.71% respectively, and the clean coal yields of different coal seams in the Central Coal Washing Plant increased by 1.23%-4.29%, realizing the \u201ceat and squeeze\u201d of coal slime. Completely solve the problem of heavy media back dust. The results of structural optimization of heavy medium cyclones in Xinjulong and Liangzhuang Coal Washing Plants are gratifying. Among them, the new Julong Coal Washing Plant\u2019s first-stage dense medium separation efficiency increased by 2%, the second-stage dense medium separation efficiency increased by 10%, and Liangzhuang Coal Washing Plant realized the direct recovery of clean coal magnetic tails, reducing repeated sorting. Five coal washing plants including Huafeng and Suncun have successfully completed the deep desliming project of laminated sieves, and the ash content of coarse and refined coal slime has been reduced by 1% to 3%. After the completion of the spiral gangue discharge project of the center and the Great Wall No. 3 Coal Washing Plant, the calorific value of China Coal will increase by 700-1200 kcal. The construction of the secondary flotation technical transformation project of the coal washing plant in Zhai Town and the Great Wall No. 1 Mine is progressing in an orderly manner. The flotation transformation of Suncun, Huafeng and Xiezhuang Coal Washing Plants was successful, and the flotation transformation of Liangzhuang Coal Washing Plant was accelerated. \"We deepened lean management, built and implemented 8 standards of safety, production, and electromechanical, and maximized synergistic advantages.\" Xu Guangqian said that by implementing the \"5 \u00d7 4\" coal preparation process management list, the coal washing production control was realized. Whole process management. Build a technology sharing platform, invite industry experts to give lectures every month, and implement internal innovation sharing. The monthly \"small and micro innovation\" evaluation was carried out to stimulate the vitality of grassroots innovation, and 170 small and micro innovations were selected from January to October. Carry out electromechanical consultation, promote \"four new\" technologies, and solve on-site problems around \"labor reduction\". Implement unified management of bulk materials, unified acceptance standards and procedures, and this year's media consumption has been reduced by 0.16 kg/ton compared with 2020.

Erbil, a painting hangs on the wall: The Little Mermaid in the water swims to the prone Aylan on the beach, trying to rescue him , but the 3-year-old boy has long been out of breath. In 2015, Little Ailan \"sleeping\" on a Mediterranean beach became the most disturbing picture of the European refugee crisis that year. Today, similar tragedies are still being staged in some parts of the world. The rights to subsistence and development, as the primary basic human rights, are still elusive to many people in the world. \"Survival is the right of the Syrians.\" If the right to survive is not guaranteed, all other rights will only be seen in the mirror at around 2:00 am on September 2, 2015, at the seaside of Bodrum, a city in southwestern Turkey. In the darkness of the night, three cars took a group of people to a fishing village, where the Kurdi couple and their two sons were. They're going to take a boat here, cross the Mediterranean, and go to Greece. At that time, the Syrian crisis entered its fifth year, and the situation became more and more chaotic, and smuggling became a last resort for many people. The ship was severely overloaded and was overturned by huge waves just minutes out of the sea. Kurdi survived, but lost forever his wife Lehan, eldest son Galib and youngest son Alan. Since the turmoil in West Asia and North Africa in 2011, refugee flows have been surging along the borders of Europe from south to east. According to estimates by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in 2011, the number of refugees who arrived in Europe via the Mediterranean Sea and died in the Mediterranean reached new highs since 2006, exceeding 58,000 and 1,500 respectively. As the turmoil in West Asia and North Africa continues, the refugee crisis intensifies. From 2014 to 2019, more than 100,000 people smuggled across the Mediterranean to Europe each year. Between 2014 and 2020, more than 20,000 stowaways died in the Mediterranean. In the first half of 2021, the death toll was 1,146, a 58% increase from the same period last year. For anyone, if the right to life is not guaranteed, all other rights are just a blur in the mirror. In a survey conducted by Xinhua News Agency reporters on people in 10 Arab countries in the Middle East, including Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Egypt, when it comes to human rights, about 70% of the respondents hope to \"live better.\" \"Survival is the right of Syrians,\" said Adnan Hazim, spokesman for the ICRC in Syria. \"We are not only talking about Syrians, but about humanity as a whole. Anywhere, anytime, (People) must enjoy this right.\u201d The hegemonic actions of the United States and the West, such as military intervention, economic sanctions, and political interference, have become prominent factors that undermine the development of relevant countries and threaten the survival of the people. The Kurdi family originally lived in the Syrian border town of Koba. Ni, life is stable. In 2011, the Syrian crisis broke out and the situation continued to deteriorate. Around 2013, Kurdi said, he noticed that things had become more different because of the coming of the Islamic State. In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq, citing the presence of weapons of mass destruction. At that time, the Bush administration wanted to implement the so-called \"Greater Middle East Democracy Project\" to replicate the American political model in Iraq, but it soon fell into a long-term confrontation with armed groups. In 2011, the United States killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, and then began to withdraw troops hastily from Iraq, but the chaos left behind brought serious consequences, and extremist terrorist forces rose rapidly. At the same time, with the help of the United States and the West, the \"Arab Spring\" hit Syria and plunged it into civil strife. The Iraqi branch of Al Qaeda took the opportunity to expand its power into Syria and changed its name to the \"Islamic State\". The Swiss historian Ganzer believes that the extremist organization \"Islamic State\" is actually \"Made in America\". Six years later, Kurdi still blames himself, believing that he had sent his wife and children to the point of no return. But he hated even more that Western intervention destroyed the original peace and forced the family to be displaced. According to incomplete statistics, since 2001, the wars and military operations launched by the United States in the name of \"anti-terrorism\" have covered about 40% of the world's countries, killing more than 800,000 people and displacing more than 38 million people. In the so-called \"Human Rights and Rule of Law Index 2021\" published by some Western institutions, the 20 countries with the lowest scores include Syria, Libya, and Venezuela. But the analysis found that among them, about 25% experienced major political changes in the so-called \"Arab Spring\", about 40% had wars in the past 20 years, and about 80% had been or are under Western sanctions... \u2026and from the perspective of modern history, almost all of these countries have been invaded or colonized by the West. It is these hegemonic acts originating from the West, such as military intervention, economic sanctions, and political interference, that have become prominent factors that undermine the development of relevant countries and threaten the survival of their people. The pursuit of happiness is the common aspiration of human beings. In a country, with a peaceful and stable environment, the right to independent development can be effectively guaranteed. After the shipwreck in 2015, Kurdi buried his two children with his own hands. For countless nights after that, he couldn't get out of the nightmare of screaming for the child in the raging waves. Tragedy should be remembered in order not to repeat itself. \"I don't want the same tragedy to happen to other children,\" Kurdi said. According to a recent survey of overseas human rights governance conducted by Xinhua News Agency, more than 43% of the respondents in the Middle East chose to \"stay away from war and turmoil, and hope that everything will get better\" when it comes to their expectations for future life. In the \"2020 Misery Index\" compiled by economist Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University, the 10 countries with the greatest survival pressure include Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, etc., while these countries are peaceful The internal environment in which development can be maintained is often destroyed by the interference of external forces. In the questionnaire survey conducted by Xinhua News Agency, more than 52% and 30% of the respondents chose \"extremely important\" or \"very important\" respectively regarding \"the role of autonomous and effective state governance in the protection of human rights\". Rwanda is a more telling example. This African country was plagued by civil war and turmoil in the 20th century, and the people were struggling. Until 2000, it was President Paul Kagame who established an independent and independent development direction and found a path suitable for the country's national conditions. After getting out of the valley and entering a period of rapid development, people's livelihood has been continuously improved. Pursuing a happy life is the common aspiration of people of all countries. A country, no matter how weak its foundation is, as long as there is a peaceful and stable environment and the right to independent development is guaranteed, it will and will surely burst out with huge potential. Every year on September 2, Kurdi delivers clothes and school bags to children in nearby refugee camps. It is Kurdi's wish and goal for the rest of his life to free more children from suffering, from hunger, and to have access to education and medical care. Between the interviews, a two-year-old boy with a pacifier slipped into the living room, looking very much like the former little Ailan. Kurdi told reporters that this is the child he gave birth to after he rebuilt his family, and he named the child \"Ailan\". \"This name is a symbol of longing and a new life.\" (Participating

economic benefits", "en_text": "December 9 marked the tenth anniversary of the completion and operation of the Qinghai-Tibet Interconnection Project, the first \"electric power road\" in Tibet. As of the end of November this year, the project has delivered a total of 8.767 billion kWh of electricity and 5.677 billion kWh of electricity to Tibet, creating direct social and economic benefits of 1.457 billion yuan. Qinghai-Tibet Interconnection Project Transmission Line The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important security barrier, ecological barrier and strategic resource base in China, and has important strategic significance in national security and development. Before 2010, the grid structure of Tibet's power grid was extremely weak, and some areas only relied on small hydropower stations, photovoltaic power stations and diesel generators for power supply. The commissioning of the Qinghai-Tibet Interconnection Project enabled the Tibet power grid to be interconnected with the national large power grid for the first time through the Qinghai power grid. Over the past ten years, relying on the valuable experience accumulated in the construction of this project, Tibet has successively built three \"electric power roads\", namely the Sichuan-Tibet Interconnection, the Tibet-Central Electricity Interconnection and the Ali Internet connection, forming the world's highest altitude, the most complex environment and the most difficult construction so far. The plateau ultra-high voltage power transmission and transformation project group. By the end of 2020, one after another \"electricity road\" will promote the continuous extension of Tibet's main power grid to more difficult and remote areas, forming a unified power grid with the main power grid covering 74 counties (districts) and major towns and towns in Tibet, and the highest electricity load is constantly refreshed Record, the electricity consumption of the whole society increased from 2.041 billion kWh in 2010 to 8.911 billion kWh in the first 11 months of this year. Driven by sufficient electricity, Tibet's gross domestic product (GDP) has grown year by year. In the first three quarters of 2021, the GDP will be 144.035 billion yuan, nearly three times the 2010 GDP. Transmission Line of Ali Interconnection Project On December 4th, the 4th \"Power Sky Road\" in Tibet, the Ali and Tibet-Central Electricity Interconnection Project was completed and put into operation. One year after the Ali networking project was put into operation, the maximum load of Ali grid was 43,300 kilowatts, an increase of 55.2% compared with the maximum load before the project was put into operation; the reliability rate of power supply reached 99.52%, an increase of 14 percentage points compared with that before the project was put into operation. Since the project was put into operation to November 30 this year, the total electricity delivered by the network channel is about 130 million kWh, accounting for 87% of the total power supply in the Ali area; Ali Power Supply Company sold 132 million kWh of electricity, a year-on-year increase of 67.27%. The commissioning of the project has promoted the realization of the same price on the same grid and the same price as the grid in Tibet. The overall electricity price has dropped by more than 55%, and 1,533 new electricity users have been added, a year-on-year increase of 77.5%. The commissioning of the project has driven the growth of social demand for electricity and significantly improved the business environment in the Ali area. Statistics from the Market Supervision and Administration Bureau of Ali Region show that by the end of 2020, the ratio of the primary, secondary and tertiary industries in the Ali region was 10.7:35.3:54; as of September 2021, the ratio of the tertiary industry structure was 6.7:37.7:55.6, and the industrial structure was more optimization. As of November 30, the total number of market entities registered in the Ali area reached 14,658, with a registered capital of 22.042 billion yuan, an increase of 36% and 64% respectively compared with the same period last year. Among them, 2,835 new market players have grown this year, and the registered capital has increased by 3.613 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of 2021, the gross domestic product of the Ali region reached 5.548 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 7%. Over the past ten years, under extreme conditions such as high cold and hypoxia, State Grid Corporation of China has made every effort to ensure the safe operation of the Qinghai-Tibet Interconnection Project. 80 overhaul projects.

"en_text": "In Latin America, a number of thinkers have contributed their insights into democracy. The famous Venezuelan historian and thinker Luis Brito Garcia believes that democracy can be regarded as the sovereignty of the majority, and sovereignty is a supreme power that does not submit to any other power. Cuban national hero and thinker Jose Mart\u00ed pointed out when talking about democracy that Latin America should build its own democratic model. He emphasized that Latin America cannot mechanically replicate the European political model. On the contrary, the Latin American political model should fully take into account the particularities and practical needs of the region. Marty wrote in his famous \"Our America\": \"The spirit of government should be in harmony with the spirit of the country. The form of government should be in accordance with the unique constitution of the country. The so-called government is nothing but the many elements of a country. It's just a balance.\" The United States has always called itself a \"beacon of democracy and freedom in the world\". But is this really the case? We may wish to explore the truth of American-style democracy through the following aspects. The first is that \"freedom of speech\" does not live up to its name. According to World Bank data, press freedom in the U.S. has deteriorated since the 2008 financial crisis. In 2008, the United States had a press freedom index of 4, ranking it 20th out of 130 countries. Since then, the index has climbed considerably, reaching its worst rating in 2019 at 25.69, placing it 48th out of 130 countries. Currently, the index is unchanged from 2019. On the other hand, the US portal Press Freedom Tracker shows 425 attacks against journalists in the US in 2020 and 180 so far in 2021, with another 55 journalists arrested and 34 journalists reporting that Their interview equipment was man-made damage. At least 120 journalists have been subpoenaed or detained since 2017. Second, the cost of US elections is staggering. Between 2016 and 2020, campaign spending in U.S. presidential elections increased by 165 percent, according to the Federal Election Commission. In 2016, the presidential campaign spent more than $1.529 billion, and in 2020 it hit a record high of $4.058 billion. Among them, Democratic candidate Biden's campaign spending was $3.154 billion, accounting for 78% of the total; Republican candidate Trump's campaign spending was $828 million, accounting for 20% of the total; other party candidates' campaign spending accounted for the total 2%. Third, the problem of social inequality is serious. Currently, the income distribution gap in the United States is at an all-time high, on par with the Great Depression on the eve of World War II. According to the forecast of Thomas Piketty, a famous economist and professor at the Paris School of Economics, in 2021 the richest 1% of the American population will account for 18.8% of the country's total income, while the poorest 50% of the population will only account for 18.8% of the country's total income. 13.3%. Inequality in the distribution of wealth in the United States has also reached an all-time high. In 2021, the richest 1 percent of U.S. households will account for 35.9 percent of the nation's wealth, while the poorest 50 percent of households will account for only 27.4 percent of the nation's wealth. Professor Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, points out that inequality in the United States is far greater than in most European countries. Professor Alston also warned that tax policy reforms in the United States would exacerbate social divisions in the United States, or make the United States the most unequal society in the world. Fourth, racial discrimination is deeply rooted. It is true that slavery in the United States has long since been abolished, but the discrimination that limited the participation of black Americans in the political, social and economic life of the country has not disappeared with it. In a report on the many existing forms of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia, Professor Alston pointed out that in the United States today, law enforcement continues to murder and maim more African-Americans than ever before. It's not getting better, and these law enforcement agencies are hardly held accountable for it. In the United States, African-American adults are 5.9 times more likely to be arrested than white adults. In addition, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 18.7% of the total U.S. population in 2020 is Hispanic, or about 62.1 million. According to a March 2021 survey of Latino American adults by the Pew Research Center, an independent polling agency, a majority of Latinos said that skin color affects their developmental opportunities, as well as daily life. Nearly half said discrimination based on race or color is a very serious problem in America today. Racial disparities such as these are undoubtedly remnants of slavery and evidence of human rights abuses in American society. Finally, there is the issue of human rights violations of Latin American immigrants. The \"American Dream\" for Latinos is turning into a nightmare. Historically, both Democratic and Republican administrations in the United States have adopted harsh immigration policies against Latinos trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. The measures taken by the US government have been strongly condemned by the international community. Regrettably, instead of being resolved, the related issues have exacerbated the crisis, with serious violations of the human rights of migrants emerging. For example, the \"zero-tolerance\" immigration policy implemented by the Trump administration has resulted in the \"separation\" of thousands of families, many of them mothers and infants. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as of March 2021, the number of migrant children in the custody of the U.S. government has exceeded 18,000, up from 17,000 the previous year, and the number is expected to continue to climb. All in all, this cruel treatment of Latin American immigrants fully exposed the hypocrisy of \"American-style human rights\". Noam Chomsky, the most influential linguist in the 20th century and a famous American thinker, pointed out that about 70% of Americans (70% of the low-income group) are completely out of the political process, which shows that the level of economic and education and political Mobilization is closely linked, and it is not surprising that popular enthusiasm for democracy is lost. This is also reminiscent of Marx's classic statement on democracy: \"Do the people have the right to establish a new state system for themselves? The answer to this question should be absolutely yes, because if the state system no longer truly expresses the will of the people , then it becomes a real thing.\u201d (Author: Emara Gheidel, associate professor at the Central University of Venezuela, translator Lou Lou, special researcher at the Research Center for Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences)"}, {"date": "2021-12-10", "title": "\u56fd\u503a\u4e1a\u52a1\u516c\u544a2021\u5e74\u7b2c168\u53f7\u2014\u2014\u5173\u4e8e\u51b3\u5b9a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u7eed\u53d1\u884c2021\u5e74\u8bb0\u8d26\u5f0f\u9644\u606f(\u5341\u56db\u671f)\u56fd\u503a\u7684\u516c\u544a", "text": "\n\u56fd\u503a\u4e1a\u52a1\u516c\u544a2021\u5e74\u7b2c168\u53f7\u2014\u2014\u5173\u4e8e\u51b3\u5b9a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u7eed\u53d1\u884c2021\u5e74\u8bb0\u8d26\u5f0f\u9644\u606f(\u5341\u56db\u671f)\u56fd\u503a\u7684\u516c\u544a\n        \n        \n\n\u56fd\u503a\u4e1a\u52a1\u516c\u544a\n\n\uff082021\u5e74\u7b2c168\u53f7\uff09\n\n\n\n\n\u3000\u3000\u6839\u636e\u56fd\u5bb6\u56fd\u503a\u53d1\u884c\u7684\u6709\u5173\u89c4\u5b9a\uff0c\u8d22\u653f\u90e8\u51b3\u5b9a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u7eed\u53d1\u884c2021\u5e74\u8bb0\u8d26\u5f0f\u9644\u606f\uff08\u5341\u56db\u671f\uff09\u56fd\u503a\uff0c\u5df2\u5b8c\u6210\u62db\u6807\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u73b0\u5c06\u6709\u5173\u4e8b\u9879\u516c\u544a\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n\n\u3000\u3000\u4e00\u3001\n\u672c\u6b21\u56fd\u503a\u8ba1\u5212\u7eed\u53d1\u884c260\u4ebf\u5143\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u7eed\u53d1\u884c\u9762\u503c\u91d1\u989d260\u4ebf\u5143\u3002\n\u672c\u6b21\u7eed\u53d1\u884c\u56fd\u503a\u7684\u8d77\u606f\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7968\u9762\u5229\u7387\u7b49\u8981\u7d20\u5747\u4e0e2021\u5e74\u8bb0\u8d26\u5f0f\u9644\u606f\uff08\u5341\u56db\u671f\uff09\u56fd\u503a\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u5373\u8d77\u606f\u65e5\u4e3a2021\u5e7410\u670818\u65e5\uff0c\u7968\u9762\u5e74\u5229\u7387\u4e3a3.53%\uff1b\u5229\u606f\u6309\u534a\u5e74\u652f\u4ed8\uff0c\u5229\u606f\u652f\u4ed8\u65e5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5e74\u76844\u670818\u65e5\u300110\u670818\u65e5\uff08\u8282\u5047\u65e5\u987a\u5ef6\uff0c\u4e0b\u540c\uff09\uff0c2051\u5e7410\u670818\u65e5\u507f\u8fd8\u672c\u91d1\u5e76\u652f\u4ed8\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u5229\u606f\u3002\u7ecf\u62db\u6807\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u7eed\u53d1\u884c\u4ef7\u683c\u4e3a103.53\u5143\uff0c\u6298\u5408\u5e74\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u4e3a3.37%\u3002\u672c\u6b21\u7eed\u53d1\u884c\u7684\u56fd\u503a\u4ece\u62db\u6807\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u81f32021\u5e7412\u670813\u65e5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u9500\uff0c\u4ece12\u670815\u65e5\u8d77\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u53d1\u884c\u7684\u540c\u671f\u56fd\u503a520\u4ebf\u5143\u5408\u5e76\u4e0a\u5e02\u4ea4\u6613\u3002\n\n\u3000\u3000\u5176\u4ed6\u4e8b\u5b9c\u6309\u300a\u56fd\u503a\u4e1a\u52a1\u516c\u544a\u300b\uff082021\u5e74\u7b2c1\u53f7\uff09\u89c4\u5b9a\u6267\u884c\u3002\n\n\u3000\u3000\u7279\u6b64\u516c\u544a\u3002\n\n     \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u8d22\u653f\u90e8\n\n\u3000\u30002021\u5e7412\u670810\u65e5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ", "line": "regulatory", "url": "https://www.pkulaw.com/chl/215f6528022c0629bdfb.html", "sentiment_pos": 0.674321, "sentiment_neg": 0.325679, "sentiment": "Positive", "energy": 4.0257273212773725e-06, "materials": 4.397520001475641e-07, "industrials": 0.0007265710155479, "consumer_discretionary": 0.0002728040562942, "consumer_staples": 4.348007860244252e-05, "health_care": 3.7319455259421375e-06, "financials": 0.9993133544921876, "information_technology": 1.1800781976489816e-05, "communication_services": 0.0004606296133715, "utilities": 1.2695744771917816e-05, "real_estate": 0.0002250914112664, "sector": "Financials", "relevance_score": 0.05487183, "relevant": false, "importance": 3, "importance1_score": 0.8346380323391831, "importance2_score": 0.5058876641709019, "importance3_score": 0.9179766710288052, "importance4_score": 0.5598602986839765, "importance5_score": 0.0217849364125409, "market_positive_score": -1.1569722, "market_neutral_score": 3.8217537, "market_negative_score": -1.866388, "market_sentiment": "Neutral", "en_title": "Treasury Bond Business Announcement No. 168 [2021]\u2014Announcement on the Decision to Renew the Second Issue of 2021 Book-entry Interest-bearing (Fourteen Tranche) Treasury Bonds", "en_text": "Government Bond Business Announcement No. 168 [2021] - Announcement on the Decision to Renew the Second Issue of 2021 Book-entry Interest-bearing (Fourteen Tranche) Government Bond Business Announcement (2021 No. 168) The Ministry of Finance has decided to issue the 2021 book-entry interest-bearing (14th tranche) treasury bonds for the second time, and the bidding has been completed.

When eating, use a knife to cut it into a grid, and put sesame oil, sesame and garlic paste (or peanut powder) on its surface. The entrance is delicate and elastic, fragrant and soft and not sticky to the teeth. Coupled with the secret shrimp paste, it is fragrant but not greasy. The taste is absolutely unforgettable. Dustpan cooking is widely welcomed by the masses. The practice is not complicated at all. Almost every family can make it and eat it. The raw materials include rice (Guixi sticky rice), lean meat, fresh shrimp, minced ginger, minced garlic, chopped green onion, lard (in moderation), peanut oil, salt, Shangyang shrimp paste (in moderation), white sesame seeds, etc., can be bought anywhere. The steps include soaking the rice overnight, and making a dustpan requires three to four or two meters. Grind the soaked rice into a slurry, the rice slurry should not be too thick, and then pour out a small amount of the top layer to make the \"wrinkle\" on the top layer of the dustpan cooker. Peel the shrimp and cut the lean meat into cubes, stir-fry with minced garlic until fragrant, then add the lard and shrimp paste into the rice milk, stir evenly, and season with an appropriate amount of salt. After the water in the steamer is boiled, put the tray or small dustpan coated with a layer of peanut oil into the pot to cook for 3 minutes, then divide the rice flour slurry into layers and pour it into the tray or small dustpan several times, and steam it. The last step is to make the wrinkle surface, which is the most difficult and laborious process. When the temperature is the highest, take out the dustpan, pour in a thin layer of rice milk, and shake it back and forth with both hands to form wrinkles. After steaming on high heat for 5-7 minutes, slightly open the lid of the steamer to let the top steam escape, then cover the lid, stop the fire, and finally add chopped green onion, white sesame and peanut oil.

theory propagandist, and information communication liaison role as an organizer, supervising the implementation of organizers, and contacting and assisting waiters.\" Recently, Liang Huakai, a party building instructor dispatched by Lianjiang City to Qingping Town, summarized the work status of the past year as a \"1+N\" work model. Liang Huakai is one of the full-time party building instructors that Lianjiang City innovatively dispatched to 21 town (street) party (work) committees and municipal direct work committees for the first time. The establishment of a team of full-time party building instructors is a vivid epitome of the Lianjiang Municipal Party Committee Organization Department strengthening the grass-roots party building work and effectively promoting the implementation of various grass-roots organization construction work. Nanfang Daily reporter Li Tingrui Correspondent Zhang Siyan Fu Yingqing Innovative model Establishing a professional training mechanism In March 2019, the Lianjiang Party Building Guidance Center was officially established. In order to solve the problems of weak party building work force in township grass-roots party organizations, few full-time party building cadres, and insufficient attention to the education and management system of party members and cadres, the Organization Department of Lianjiang Municipal Party Committee innovatively provided 21 town (street) Party (work) committees and cadres for the first time. The Municipal Direct Work Committee dispatches at least 2 full-time party building instructors to supervise and promote the party building work of the stationed units. After nearly two years of training, there are currently 47 full-time party building instructors in the city, of which 83.70% have undergraduate degrees and 95.30% are under the age of 35. \"The team of full-time party building instructors promotes the upgrading of grassroots party building work forces, stimulates the vitality of grassroots party building work, unblocks the 'last mile' of grassroots party building, and opens up the city's top-down linkage party building network. It is a high-level, professional and capable team. .\" The relevant person in charge of the Organization Department of the Lianjiang Municipal Party Committee said that in order to build a diversified, multi-level and multi-form party building instructor training mechanism, they formulated a party building instructor training plan in detail. Implement the pre-job training and regular training system, incorporate the training of party building instructors into the \"secretary class\", \"beginning class\" and \"organization class\" to organize the training of cadres, and organize them to the Red Revolution Education Base, Party Building Leading Rural Revitalization Demonstration Village, and Patriotism Education Base Conduct on-site lectures and observations. Regularly carry out post training, hold many party building knowledge competitions, business lectures and evaluations and other activities, and exchange and learn from advanced experience between party building instructors at different locations. At the same time, establish a \"help-passing\" learning system. The person in charge of the Business Unit of the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee is responsible for one-on-one business guidance with the party building instructors who study with the class, participates in the organization and cadre management, and conducts \"one-hour\" centralized learning activities on a regular basis every Friday. The Municipal Party Construction Guidance Center is responsible for the daily management and coordination of the party construction instructors, clarifying the responsibilities, tasks and work requirements of the party construction instructors, and conducting an annual performance assessment for the party construction instructors at the end of each year. Last year, seven outstanding party building instructors were selected. \"In the process of party building, there are many difficulties and problems. The first one is the problem of mobilization.\" The relevant person in charge of the Organization Department of the Lianjiang Municipal Party Committee introduced that if it is difficult for party building units and grass-roots party building workers to break the inertial thinking, they will not be able to apply new development concepts. It is easy to cause the lack of integration, openness and differentiation of grass-roots party building when applied to grass-roots party building. Guided by the needs of party building, Lianjiang City is equipped with a strong mobilization education team. The party school of towns, offices, enterprises and parks is headed by the secretary of the party (work) committee, and the leader in charge is the vice-president. Party school full-time teachers, party and government leading cadres, enterprise leaders, advanced typical figures, \"five old\" personnel and other full-time and part-time party building instructors are included in the teacher pool. A number of grassroots governance points have been established, including the Neighborhood Council, \"Shenge Mediation Studio\", \"Hejia Studio\", and the Veteran Cadre Business Council. These governance points integrate resources such as party building, comprehensive governance, cultural creation, ecological environmental protection, health and health, emergency management, etc. model, and inspire urban residents to participate in co-construction, co-governance and sharing with the spirit of ownership. Through the establishment of a specialized training mechanism, the \"tentacles\" of grassroots party building in Lianjiang City can be extended, the \"meridians\" can be dredged, and the \"cells\" can be activated. Under the leadership of party building, government agencies, enterprises, institutions and \"two new\" organizations have integrated party members into grids, substantiation, and real names into the specific activities of urban grassroots party building. The majority of residents have been mobilized, and social resources, management authority, and people's livelihood services have been decentralized, which has enhanced the identification and support of party members and community residents for the city's party building, and strengthened the community's functions of serving the people, facilitating the people, and bringing peace to the people. Build a strong team to build the \"main force\" of grass-roots party building. There are many party building instructors like Liang Huakai who has a \"1+N\" job in Lianjiang. The party building instructors Wu Xiaorong and Huang Caishan, who are stationed in Shicheng Town, help the construction of village-level party building positions and continue to follow up. The Party branch of Potou Village built the \"beginning classroom\"; sent Lin Huafeng, a party building instructor stationed in Cheban Town, to formulate a brochure for the development of party members in rural areas, strictly guarding the \"entry gate\" for the development of party members, and actively connected with relevant departments to open the online transfer function of the special account for party fees, which is convenient Rural party members regularly pay party dues online; Lu Jingzhi, a party building instructor stationed in Xinmin Town, is a post-90s college student who has returned to his hometown to work. Ma Zeyu, a party building instructor in Chengbei Street, gave full play to his work experience and educational resources to set up a night school for young cadres training.

In response to the problem of \"blocking\" information in grass-roots organizations, the Organization Department of the Lianjiang Municipal Party Committee has established a management mechanism for \"weekly reports and quarterly annual examinations\", and introduced feedback systems such as \"Party Construction Instructors Two-week Work Items Report\" and \"Major Work Request Report System\". The work tasks are to refine the information feedback mechanism and reporting system. The dispatched party building instructors regularly report the work progress every two weeks, report important information at critical moments, break the previous information barriers that the grassroots reported untimely, and contribute to the party building work in Lianjiang City. Provide first-hand information, and implement \"precise measures\" on problems and difficulties as soon as possible. According to statistics, the party building instructor team has submitted a total of 528 work information in the weekly report, and has written a total of 138 information drafts of various grass-roots party building suggestions. It provides important reference for promoting the work well. \"When I was the busiest at work, I remembered that the revolutionary martyrs in Guangdong and Guangxi fought bloody battles for the liberation cause more than 70 years ago. This spirit of the bottom of the mountain deeply inspired me.\" At the same time, he also served as the garrison work in Shanyao Village. The Shijiao Town Party Construction Office where Liao Youxi is located is one of the workstations where Lianjiang City is actively exploring the establishment of an inter-provincial boundary party building alliance. He is responsible for the daily liaison affairs of the workstation, and leads the team to organize party members and cadres from all over Guangdong and Guangxi to the red at the bottom of the mountain.

Party building development put forward more than 1,000 rationalization opinions. \"Party building instructors are very down-to-earth, willing and capable.\" Zhong Guilin, secretary of the Party Committee of Qingping Town, Lianjiang City, said that the team of party building instructors is rooted at the grassroots level, integrating party building into various tasks such as poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, and playing a pioneering role in party members. exemplary role.

"en_text": "In the cold winter season, the breeze blows by the Jiuzhou River. Strings of red oranges sway in the wind in the mountains and fields of Lianjiang, like yellow lanterns, rendering the bright colors of the harvest. A river of clear water is like broken silver, and the mountains are full of green and gold. The water and soil of the Lianjiang River is the perfect place for oranges. The average annual temperature here is 22.9\u00b0C, and the granite parent soil and abundant sunlight in the southwest have bred the best-quality red oranges. The planting area of red oranges is 82,000 mu, with nearly 100,000 employees. Lianjiang City is also known as the \"Hometown of Red Oranges in China\". Times change, but the taste remains the same. Nowadays, more and more orange farmers are beginning to try new things, becoming anchors, going online... More and more Lianjiang red oranges are going to the dining table at home and abroad. Strategic location \u25b6 Create a juicy and sweet Lingnan Jiaguo to pick a red orange, I saw that the peel is smooth and delicate, revealing a golden luster, and it is heavy in the hand, \"The authentic Lianjiang red orange must be juicy and thin-skinned. , and sweet and sour.\" This is true, take a bite, and the red and orange juice rushes down the corner of the mouth, the sugar and acidity are perfectly balanced, and every bite is arousing a subtle nostalgia. Red oranges begin to ripen in November. After the cold wind blows, its flavor can accumulate. \"Lianjiang is in the subtropical zone. The temperature difference between day and night in November and December is large. After many days, red oranges that are tender and slag, with moderate sweetness and sourness are raised.\" Guo Guixian, the fruit farmer who spoke, has been planting red oranges for more than ten years. . From the initial period of more than 20 acres to now contracting multiple orange orchards and transmitting the technology of growing oranges and raising oranges, Mrs. Guo has been with Red Orange every day. \"We have plenty of sunshine here, and the soil is the most suitable for planting. It is difficult not to grow good red oranges.\" Sister Guo sighed while picking red oranges. The Lianjiang red orange mother plant was found in the Xinhui orange garden planted in 1960 by the state-run Hongjiang Farm in Lianjiang City. After years of development, Lianjiang Red Orange is famous all over the world. In May last year, Lianjiang red orange, a protected geographical indication product in China, was selected into the first batch of national famous, special and excellent new agricultural products list. But in fact, the risk of planting red oranges is not small. \"Citrus Huanglongbing\" has been regarded as \"citrus cancer\". Sister Guo said that in the past, many fruit farmers were not good at management, oranges suffered from Huanglongbing disease, and an orange tree could only live for three or four years. \"Many people stop planting when they grow, and go out to find a way.\" This year, Lianjiang fruit is in good condition. The market price is generally 7-10 yuan per catty, and many people have high yields and good harvests. Online and offline linkage \u25b6 Expand the popularity of Lianjiang red orange \"Hello everyone, I'm Sister Guo, this is my orchard. The red orange juice in my house is thin, and everyone is welcome to come and pick it...\" Sister Guo turned to the screen of her mobile phone Record the video again and again. Sister Guo is cheerful by nature, but she is still a little shy in front of the camera. Speaking in Mandarin, which is not very fluent, she said with a smile, \"Many orange orchard managers are now recording videos to promote their oranges, and I want to try it.\" Now, by upgrading the brand and expanding channels, Lianjiang Red Orange It has successively entered supermarkets such as the new retail giant Hema Xiansheng. At the same time, with the help of modern Internet e-commerce platform and Internet of Things technology, Lianjiang Red Orange has achieved omni-channel coverage in major supermarkets across the country such as JD.com, Tmall, Hema Fresh, Wal-Mart, RT-Mart and so on. In addition, it also relies on local online e-commerce companies such as Orange Township Taste, Lingnan Lianjiang Hongcheng Electronic Marketing Platform, Zhanda E-commerce, and Supply and Marketing Ejia for sales. In Lianjiang, traditional fruit farmers, new farmers and even government departments are working together to tell the story about red oranges. Lianjiang is promoting the planting of disease-free seedlings, and fruit farmers are getting better and better with the promotion of new technologies. Some native \"new farmers\" are also willing to give up their high-paying jobs and return to their hometowns to promote red oranges-Maidan, general manager of Lianjiang Chengxiang Renjia Agricultural Development Co., Ltd., and the company's young people wrote an article based on \"red line oranges\". The script of \"Orange Bonding\" is self-directed and self-acted and broadcast on various short video platforms. Last year, Lianjiang's large-scale original musical \"Red Orange Romance\" used red orange as a medium, connecting elements such as intangible cultural heritage, rural revitalization, and legends, telling a new story of a generation planting red oranges in the countryside. This year, Lianjiang formulated the national geographical indication protection product \"Lianjiang Red Orange\" brand standard to boost the upgrading of the Lianjiang red orange industry. The protection and promotion of Lianjiang red oranges are being staged from generation to generation in the land of Lianjiang.

help farmers increase their income. This year is another harvest year.\" Although it is winter, at the Camellia Oil Base of Mingfeng Modern Agricultural Development Co., Ltd. in Midu Village, Shima Town, Xingning City, the oil in the mountains is full of oil. Tea trees put \"green clothes\" on the mountains and forests. The peak season of camellia processing in the year is coming. In the processing plant in the mountains, workers are busy picking and drying tea seeds. The head of the base, Liu Mingyuan, flipped over the monitoring page of his mobile phone, tapped his finger, and the base began to irrigate automatically. In recent years, Meizhou has vigorously developed the camellia oil industry. At present, the planting area of camellia in Meizhou is more than 700,000 mu. It is the main camellia production area in the province. The output of camellia oil is about 9,500 tons, and the output value is about 2.5 billion yuan. In the clear waters and green mountains, gold and silver mountains were found, and camellia oleifera became a \"green bank\" for local farmers. A few days ago, Meizhou issued the \"Meizhou City's Implementation Plan for Promoting the High-Quality Development of the Camellia Oil Industry\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Plan\"), and formulated reward and subsidy policies around building a standardized Camellia Camellia industrial park, cultivating leading Camellia oleifera enterprises, and building a modern Camellia industry cluster, aiming to strive for By 2025, the comprehensive output value of the camellia oil industry will be 4 billion yuan. For tea farmers, small camellia fruit is bringing greater development opportunities. Looking for the long-term, the camellia oleifera industry ushered in the \"spring\" of development Although the picking period has passed, in Huangpi Town, Xingning City, the lush green camellia oleifera forests still bring vitality to the local area. Qiu Ming, a big planter, told reporters that in Xingning, the \"hometown of Chinese camellia\", camellia oleifera is the main source of income for villagers in Huangpi and other towns. Last year, planting camellia oleifera brought him nearly 300,000 yuan in income. Camellia oleifera industry is an ancient and emerging industry. In Meizhou, Camellia oleifera has a long tradition of planting. Xingning City and Pingyuan County were awarded the title of \"Hometown of Camellia oleifera in China\", and Pingyuan County was also listed as the \"National Forestry of Camellia High-yield Forest\". Standardized Demonstration Area\". Since 2005, the Meizhou Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have regarded Camellia oleifera as an \"ecological enrichment\" industry to develop the mountain economy and increase farmers' income. The development of Camellia oleifera in Meizhou has ushered in a rare opportunity. At present, the planting area of camellia in Meizhou is more than 700,000 mu, mainly distributed in Xingning City, Pingyuan County, Wuhua County, Dapu County and Fengshun County. The output of camellia oil is about 9,500 tons, and the output value is about 2.5 billion yuan. There are 5 Camellia oleifera enterprises in the city that have won the title of National Forestry Key Leading Enterprise. Recently, the \"Plan\" was introduced, adding another fire to the development of the camellia oleifera industry. \"The introduction of the \"Plan\" is like a booster, which has inspired the morale of farmers and enterprises that develop camellia.\" Huang Yibin, general manager of Pingyuan County Xindadi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., said that in recent years, the company has been dominated by the development of the camellia oil industry. , adopt the model of \"company + base + farmers\" to drive surrounding farmers to plant more than 50,000 mu of camellia oleifera. Through the development of forest tourism, the sales of economic crops under the surrounding forests will increase the economic income of forest farmers, and the average annual income of households will increase by 4,000 yuan. \"Meizhou's soil and climate are suitable for planting camellia oleifera. Although it takes 5 years after planting to bear fruit, the cycle is long, and management can be done in place. It is not a problem to have a high yield for decades.\" A true \"green bank\". \"Each camellia seed, dripping tea oil fragrance.\" Camellia oleifera is a treasure all over the body. It can not only produce pure natural green and healthy high-end edible oil, but also is an important high-quality raw material for the food, pharmaceutical, chemical and cosmetic industries. The by-products of camellia oleifera have high utilization value, and tea seed cake and tea saponin can be widely used in daily chemical industry, papermaking, chemical fiber, textile, pesticide and other fields. At present, Meizhou Camellia has developed products including alpine camellia oil, camellia oil vitamin E capsules, camellia seed shampoo, camellia seed shower gel, whitening skin care camellia oil, baby skin care camellia oil, pure natural detergent, tea saponin, tea For dozens of products, including meal, bio-organic fertilizer, etc., the ratio of the initial value of camellia seeds to the value of the final product can reach 1:20. \"According to the \"Plan\", Meizhou plans to build a batch of standardized camellia oleifera industrial parks with high standards in five years, cultivate a number of leading camellia enterprises, and create a modern camellia industrial cluster. By 2025, the comprehensive output value of the camellia industry is expected to reach 4 billion yuan.\" Meizhou Chen Yuncai, the relevant person in charge of the Industry Section of the Municipal Forestry Bureau, said that there are subsidies and incentive policies in five aspects, such as the new construction and transformation of camellia oleifera forests, the honor and listing of camellia enterprises, equipment purchase, scientific and technological support, and regional brand cultivation. , For enterprises, it is a major benefit. \"Now the government has policies to support the cultivation of camellia oleifera industry. As long as our farmers cultivate Camellia oleifera with intensive cultivation, the future prospects are bright, and Camellia oleifera fruit will definitely become the rich fruit of local farmers.\" said Liu Mingyuan, President of Xingning Camellia Oil Association and Mingfeng Modern Agricultural Development Co., Ltd. . Strong industrial variety improvement, low-yield transformation to increase benefits \"Pest branches, dead branches, excessively dense cross branches, overlapping branches, etc. should be cut off, and the ventilation and light transmission conditions can be improved by pruning and shaping, which can cultivate a good tree structure...\" In January this year, technicians from the Forestry Research Institute of Meizhou Academy of Agriculture and Forestry visited the Camellia Oil Camellia Base in Xiansheng Village, Xinpi Town, Xingning City, bringing high-yield Camellia oleifera planting knowledge and technology to representatives of 18 Camellia oleifera enterprises and Camellia farmers in the city. In recent years, although Meizhou has vigorously developed the camellia oleifera industry, factors such as extensive management, inadequate maintenance, and uneven quality of seedlings have resulted in low yield and poor benefits of the existing camellia oleifera trees that should have entered the high-yield period, seriously restricting the industrialization of camellia oleifera. develop. \"On the one hand, farmers have a backward concept and know little about high-yield technologies such as high-crown grafting, low-yield forest transformation and pruning, and fertilization, and their management is extensive. On the other hand, they are subject to the low degree of improved varieties. Such conditions have led to problems such as loss of control and low output of camellia oleifera.\" Liu Mingyuan said that the increase in output directly affects the income of farmers, and many farmers invest less and less in planting camellia oleifera, and their enthusiasm is greatly reduced. \"Now the raw materials need to be purchased outside, and the logistics cost has increased a lot.\" Baoyi Ecological Technology (Guangdong) Co., Ltd. is a whole industry chain supplier of camellia products in Xingning. Fang Yi, general manager of the company, said, \"This year, the company acquired 2,000 tons of camellia seeds were purchased, most of which came from outside Meizhou, and the low local production led to a shortage of raw materials, so companies had to shift their purchasing direction to outside camellia oil bases.\" Not only is it difficult for companies to purchase tea seeds, but the competition in the market for farmers' camellia products is also increasing. fierce. With the influx of tea seeds produced in Jiangxi, Guangxi, Hunan and other places into the local tea oil raw material market, the price difference between the tea oil produced by tea seeds in other provinces and the local self-produced tea oil can even reach 1/3 of the local price, which has also exacerbated Meizhou. It is no wonder that farmers are selling tea seeds and crude oil. \"Currently, implementing scientific planting, giving full play to the supporting role of science and technology, and making efforts in the selection of new varieties of Camellia oleifera and the transformation of low-yield and low-efficiency forests are the keys to solving the strange phenomenon.\" Liu Mingyuan said that by improving varieties and technologies, transforming existing low-yielding plants For Camellia oleifera forests, only by increasing the yield and quality can the costs and prices be suppressed, the benefits be improved, and the sales market be unblocked. Change followed. This year, Xingning City implemented the first phase of the transformation of 30,000 mu of low-yield and low-efficiency forests, implemented policy and financial support, and was committed to improving the extensive management of camellia oleifera. \"Under the support and guidance of the government, we started to transform camellia oleifera fruit after picking the camellia fruit last year.\" Liu Mingyuan said that at present, the base's 2,800 mu of camellia oleifera forest has been transformed into more than 1,100 mu. It is expected that the yield per mu will increase by 5 times after the transformation. It can also improve the oil yield. In the transformation of camellia oleifera forest, Ruifengyuan Modern Agriculture Development Co., Ltd. in Huangpi Town, Xingning City also tasted the sweetness. Since 2009, the company has been committed to the introduction of improved camellia seeds. At present, the planting demonstration base of the improved seeds produces 1,711 jin/mu of fresh fruit, which is more than 4 times higher than that of the well-maintained old tea forest in the area. The good news continues to be implemented. In the \"Plan\" issued, Meizhou has a corresponding subsidy policy for supporting farmers to build new high-yield Camellia oleifera forests, low-yield and low-efficiency Camellia oleifera forests, replanting and replanting, so as to improve economic benefits and increase income for Meizhou tea farmers. , brought new development opportunities. Tree Brands Help Meizhou Camellia Go Globally More than a month has passed since the fruit picking of Shuangjiang Camellia oleifera, and Baoyi Ecological Technology (Guangdong) Co., Ltd. located in Xingning City has ushered in a busy processing season. Outside the factory, workers are drying camellia oleifera fruit in fine weather; inside the factory, the production line machines are roaring. After repeated screening, decontamination, cold pressing and cold extraction, the tea seeds are turned into bottles of healthy camellia oil, ready to be sold all over the world. . \"From tea seeds to a qualified drop of oil, 36 processes are required.\" Fang Yi told reporters that the company introduced a new double-screw pressing production line, which can process 20 tons of tea seed raw materials and 5 tons of refined refined oil per day. Compared with the traditionally pressed camellia oil, the company adopts multiple low-temperature filtering impurities in the cold pressing process, which effectively retains the inherent fragrance, biological active substances and natural characteristics of camellia oil such as linolenic acid, linoleic acid, and various trace elements. better than ever. \"Currently, the company's main product is camellia oil, and its annual sales increase steadily. This product alone has sales of more than 20 million yuan. It has many customer groups in Guangdong, Sichuan, Chongqing, Beijing, Hunan, Jiangxi and other places.\" Fang. It is said that through intensive processing, the company has developed more than 10 kinds of tea seed washing products such as \"6000-year-old\" camellia oil and \"Mei Chunbao\", with an annual comprehensive output value of more than 30 million yuan. People in the industry generally believe that the development of the camellia oil industry is still in the growth stage. As long as it insists on good quality, its development prospects are very broad. How does the prospect become reality? In terms of brand promotion efforts and resource integration, many leaders of camellia oleifera companies have put forward their opinions. \"Although the camellia oil industry has developed very well in Meizhou, the current market lacks sufficient understanding of camellia oil, and the price of camellia oil is also higher than that of other edible oils. Consumers' understanding of camellia oil is limited to what it is.\" The impression of oriental olive oil'.\" Huang Yibin said, \"raised in a boudoir and unknown to people\" is still the status quo faced by camellia oil, and it is necessary to increase publicity, improve consumers' acceptance of camellia oil in Meizhou, and make camellia oil products out of the siege. \"At present, there is no memorable core camellia oil product in the country, and the core competitiveness has not yet emerged. Meizhou camellia companies have many and miscellaneous brands, which cannot further improve the brand effect of camellia oil and additional products.\" Fang Yi said, The government should strengthen guidance, focus on building a big brand of \"Meizhou Camellia\", comprehensively enhance the overall competitiveness and popularity of Meizhou Camellia, give full play to the leading role of leading enterprises, and change the current \"low, small and scattered\" situation of camellia oil processing enterprises. The camellia oil industry will be gradually built into a green pillar industry that enriches the people. At present, there are many small-scale processing enterprises of camellia oil in Meizhou, and most of them are still in the primary processing stage of camellia oil. The production points are scattered, and the management level of enterprises is mixed. Quality management system, tea oil has different quality and price, some consumers do not recognize it, which reduces the brand effect. In order to promote the Meizhou camellia industry to become an advantageous industry with good comprehensive benefits and sustainable development, the \"Plan\" also has incentives and support policies in terms of scientific and technological support, awards and subsidies, regional brand cultivation, and the launch of the \"Meizhou camellia oil\" brand. Liu Mingyuan believes that the current development of the Camellia oleifera industry should improve quality and efficiency, focus on the fine management of the existing Camellia oleifera bases, avoid blind expansion, cultivate the main body of breeding, intensive processing and sales of improved varieties with strong market competitiveness, and build The interest linkage mechanism for farmers' planting and the acquisition and processing of leading enterprises; at the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the supervision of the industry, standardize the market access mechanism of camellia oil, and improve the standard system and quality management system of camellia oleifera products. \"With the introduction of the \"Plan\", Camellia products are also more confident to go out.\" Liu Mingyuan said. \u25a0Relevant five aspects make efforts to launch the \"Meizhou Camellia Oil\" brand Recently, Meizhou issued the \"Meizhou City's Implementation Plan for Promoting the High-Quality Development of Camellia Oil Industry\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Plan\"), and plans to build a batch of standardized Camellia oleifera industries with high standards in five years Park, cultivate a number of leading companies of camellia oleifera, build a modern industrial cluster of camellia oleifera, build a whole industrial chain of camellia oleifera, and launch the characteristic regional brand of \"Meizhou camellia oil\". By 2025, the comprehensive output value of the camellia oil industry is expected to reach 4 billion yuan. The \"Plan\" makes it clear that from 2021 to 2025, Meizhou will strengthen the research and development of camellia oleifera breeding technology, promote the expansion and quality of camellia oleifera forests, expand and strengthen the main body of camellia oleifera management, promote the complex management of camellia oleifera forests, and launch the \"Meizhou camellia oil\" \"Brand and other five aspects to make efforts. It is planned to select 3-5 excellent varieties suitable for planting in Meizhou within 5 years, increase the area of newly built high-yield camellia oleifera forest by 100,000 mu, and carry out upgrading and transformation of 182,000 mu of low-yield and low-efficiency camellia oleifera forests in the city, and strive to cultivate camellia oleifera forestry leaders above the provincial level. There are 10 enterprises, developing intensive processing, developing more high value-added products, and the annual processing capacity of refined camellia oil is more than 50,000 tons. At the same time, promote the integration of the camellia oil industry with the cultivation of southern medicine, garden flowers, forest health tourism and other industries, increase the cultivation of regional brands, actively apply for the registration of the \"Meizhou camellia oil\" national geographical indication certification mark, and vigorously apply for the \"Meizhou camellia oil\" national Geographical indication protection products. The \"Plan\" pointed out that Meizhou will strengthen support policies for the high-quality development of the camellia oleifera industry in terms of finance, finance, technology, and infrastructure construction. Especially in terms of financial support, in the subsidy policy for new construction and transformation of camellia oleifera forests, it is proposed that starting from 2021, new high-yield camellia oleifera forests with a contiguous area of more than 20 mu will be given a planting subsidy at the standard of not less than 800 yuan/mu in the first year. From the second year to the fifth year, the annual subsidy is 200 yuan/mu; the low-yield and low-efficiency camellia oleifera forest reclamation, replanting and transformation, the subsidy is not less than 500 yuan/mu. In the incentive policies for camellia oil companies to obtain honors and go public, it is proposed that from 2021 to 2025, a one-time reward of 500,000 yuan will be given to the newly identified or monitored and evaluated national key leading forestry enterprises in previous years; those who have won the title of Guangdong Forestry Leading Enterprise A one-time reward of not less than 100,000 yuan will be given to companies that are listed on the main board; 5 million yuan will be given to companies that plan to list on the main board and get a receipt from the securities regulatory authority; 3 million yuan will be given to enterprises that have received the trial receipt; 3 million yuan will be given to enterprises that plan to list on the Hong Kong and overseas stock exchanges and have obtained the trial receipt from the competent review department. In the science and technology support award and subsidy policy, it is proposed to focus on supporting the construction of Camellia oleifera enterprise technology centers, testing centers, etc., and provide a one-time subsidy of 800,000 yuan, 500,000 yuan and 300,000 yuan to the implementing units at the national, provincial and municipal levels respectively; For units leading or participating in the formulation of international standards, national standards and industry standards, a one-time subsidy of 500,000 yuan, 200,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan will be given respectively.
